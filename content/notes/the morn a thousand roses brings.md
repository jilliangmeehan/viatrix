title: "the morn a thousand roses brings"
draft: false
---

the title of this archon quest comes from [the rubaiyat of omar khayyam](http://www.davidgorman.com/rubaiyat.htm#:~:text=Each%20Morn%20a%20thousand%20Roses,take%20Jamshyd%20and%20Kaikobad%20away) — a very interesting poem with a lot of things that are very relevant to genshin lore. i highly recommend reading the whole thing, but i've pulled out a bunch of stanzas here that i wanted to make note of.

> [!NOTE]
> there's a lot to do with **wine** in this poem that i haven't really included here because it's a whole thing & i want to sit down and go over it all in one pass.

stanzas 1 & 2:
> WAKE! For the [[notes/sun|Sun]], who scatter’d into flight
The Stars before him from the Field of Night,
  Drives Night along with them from Heav’n, and strikes
The Sultan’s Turret with a Shaft of Light.

> Before the phantom of False morning died,
Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,

false sky?

---

stanzas 6 & 7:
> Iram indeed is gone with all his [[notes/rose|Rose]],
And Jamshyd’s Sev’n-ring’d Cup where no one knows;
  But still a Ruby kindles in the Vine,
And many a Garden by the Water blows. 


> And David’s lips are lockt; but in divine
High-piping Pehlevi, with "Wine! Wine! Wine!
  "Red Wine!"—the Nightingale cries to the [[notes/rose|Rose]]
That sallow cheek of hers to’ incarnadine.

i just love a nightingale & rose mention.

---

stanza 8:
> Come, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring
Your Winter garment of Repentance fling:
  The Bird of Time has but a little way
To flutter—and the Bird is on the Wing.

the bird of time — is this referring also to the nightingale? another type of bird? istaroth?

---

stanza 9:
> Each Morn a thousand Roses brings, you say:
Yes, but where leaves the [[notes/rose|Rose]] of Yesterday?
  And this first Summer month that brings the [[notes/rose|Rose]]
Shall take Jamshyd and Kaikobad away.

the titular stanza! this one really gets at the essence of the whole poem — every day brings both new life and loss.

---
stanza 58:
> And lately, by the Tavern Door agape,
Came shining through the Dusk an Angel Shape
  Bearing a Vessel on his Shoulder; and
He bid me taste of it; and ’twas—the Grape!

haha angel's share

---

stanza 59:
> The Grape that can with Logic absolute
The Two-and-Seventy jarring Sects confute:
  The sovereign Alchemist that in a trice
Life’s leaden metal into Gold transmute;

**two-and-seventy** = 72 demons in ars goetia

**sovereign alchemist ... into Gold transmute** = possibly refers to rhinedottir

(also "in a trice" = quickly)

---

stanzas 62 & 63:
> Of threats of Hell and Hopes of Paradise!
One thing at least is certain—This Life flies;
  One thing is certain and the rest is Lies;
The Flower that once has blown for ever dies.

> Strange, is it not? that of the myriads who
Before us pass’d the door of Darkness through,
  Not one returns to tell us of the Road,
Which to discover we must travel too.

as you may have noticed by now: this whole poem is very much about the cycle of life, the inevitability of death, the journey to the afterlife, etc.

---

stanza 67:
> Heav’n but the Vision of fulfill’d Desire,
And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,
  Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves,
So late emerged from, shall so soon expire.

i have a theory (that this reminds me of) that visions are granted when you *fulfill a desire or dream* of a past soul — determined by the stars in your constellation.

---

stanzas 68 & 69:
> We are no other than a moving row
Of Magic Shadow-shapes that come and go
  Round with the [[notes/sun|Sun]]-illumined Lantern held
In Midnight by the Master of the Show; 

> But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays
Upon this Chequer-board of Nights and Days;
  Hither and thither moves, and checks, and slays,
And one by one back in the Closet lays.

chess theory 😵‍💫

**the sun-illumined lantern held in midnight** = the [[notes/moon|moon]]?

---

stanza 70:
> And He that toss’d you down into the Field,
He knows about it all—HE knows—HE knows!

who is he!!!

---

stanzas 78 & 79:
> What! out of senseless Nothing to provoke
A conscious Something to resent the yoke
  Of unpermitted Pleasure, under pain
Of Everlasting Penalties, if broke!

> What! from his helpless Creature be repaid
Pure Gold for what he lent him dross-allay’d—
  Sue for a Debt he never did contract,
And cannot answer—Oh the sorry trade!

something something original sin, something something punishment for pleasure, something something debt collection.

starting at stanza 81, there's a whole section where a bunch of clay "vessels" aka just people are standing around talking about the "potter" / god who made them and being like ah surely i wasn't made in vain right, surely you wouldn't fuck up your own creation right. 

and then one of them goes *"Who is the Potter, pray, and who the Pot?"* and THEN one of them is like, *i heard a rumor that the potter throws the ones he accidentally fucked up into hell but THAT can't be true right*. and then we've got this in stanza 89:

> Then said another with long-drawn Sigh,
My Clay with long Oblivion is gone dry:
  But fill me with the old familiar Juice,
Methinks I might recover by and by."

filling the vessel with wine after it runs out. interesting! fits well alongside my vision theory above (which i'll expand on somewhere, sometime...eventually).

---

stanzas 96, 97, & 98:
> Yet Ah, that Spring should vanish with the [[notes/rose|Rose]]!
That Youth’s sweet-scented manuscript should close!
  The Nightingale that in the branches sang,
Ah whence, and whither flown again, who knows! 

> Would but the Desert of the Fountain yield
One glimpse—if dimly, yet indeed, reveal’d,
  To which the fainting Traveler might spring,
As springs the trampled herbage of the field!

> Would but some winged Angel ere too late
Arrest the yet unfolded Roll of Fate,
  And make the stern Recorder otherwise
Enregister, or quite obliterate!

hmmge. no coherent thoughts on this right now but there's something here that i want to think about more.

---

stanza 99:
> Ah Love! could you and I with Him conspire
To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,
  Would not we shatter it to bits—and then
Re-mold it nearer to the **Heart’s Desire!**

heart's desire — like the book.

---

stanzas 100 & 101:
> Yon rising [[notes/moon|Moon]] that looks for us again—
How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;
  How oft hereafter rising look for us
Through this same Garden—and for one in vain! 


> And when like her, oh Saki, you shall pass
Among the Guests Star-scatter’d on the Grass,
  And in your joyous errand reach the spot
Where I made One—turn down an empty Glass!

and that's where it ends!
