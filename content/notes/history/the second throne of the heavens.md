- **? years after [[notes/history/the ark's opening|the ark's opening]]**, [[the second who came]] appeared and waged war against [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]], resulting in the destruction of the heavens and earth
- fall of the [[notes/characters/seelies|seelies]]
- fall of the [[notes/characters/three moon sisters|three moon sisters]]
- [[notes/places/enkanomiya|enkanomiya]] fell into the ocean
- **after the war**, "whoever emerged victorious" took control of the heavens + "forbade knowledge" of history before the war — the people of [[notes/places/enkanomiya|enkanomiya]] believed [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] won, but apparently it's unknown
- supposedly [[rex lapis]] was alive + very young at this time

> [!NOTE]
> the exact chain of events here is unclear to me — how long was the second who came in this world before the disaster? was the disaster caused by the failed changing of the moons, or was that a result of the war?
