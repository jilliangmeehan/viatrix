this is a very work-in-progress overview of the timeline & history of teyvatâ€‰â€”â€‰as far as we know it, i guess. most of this is pulled from the [wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline), so if you're looking for something more comprehensive, that's the place to go.

much of the genshin timeline is still very speculative. we don't really know for sure when certain things happened or what the exact order of events was. but i'm hoping that laying it all out here will help me start to make some sense of it.

i think it's probably going to take me a while to figure out the best way to organize this. obviously, a timeline should be written in the order that events happenedâ€‰â€”â€‰but there are also so *many* timelines happening concurrently across different regions & civilizations. 

i would like this page to be a glance-able overview of everything, with subpages dedicated to delving deeper into the history of specific areas, like [[notes/places/enkanomiya|enkanomiya]]. hopefully that doesn't get too confusing.

## archon war
we don't know when the [[archon war]] began, but we do know it lasted until about **2000 years ago**. because there is so much happening concurrently here, i've done my best to split it up by region.
