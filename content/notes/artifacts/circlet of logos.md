title: "circlet of logos"

[*logos*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos#Gnosticism) is one of the three pillars of rhetoric, along with pathos and ethos. in that context, it represents reason and logic. 

logos also has a lot of religious significance — christianity refers to jesus as an incarnation of logos, which [[gnosticism]] seems to have some feelings about as well. 

i haven't really sorted through all of this yet, but i do think that it would be a mistake to assume that *logos* here is only related to logic, without considering any sort of attachment to the "divine." especially considering the actual piece: a circlet, a tiara, a crown, etc.
