the initiate artifact set is unobtainable — you only see it on trial characters in quest domains. the only two pieces are the [[notes/artifacts/flower of life|flower of life]] and [[notes/artifacts/plume of death|plume of death]].

## [[notes/artifacts/flower of life|initiate's flower]]
> A small flower. Cute and adorable, just like the early spring of North Teyvat.

## [[notes/artifacts/plume of death|initiate's feather]]
> An item attached to the grip of a traveler's first sword, bearing the modest dreams of its wielder.
