this artifact set is — surprise! — about [[the sojourner]] of the [[wanderers’ troupe]]. it tells part of the story of the four members meeting each other and forming the troupe, as well as their failed uprising against the mondstadt aristocrats. 

what i find really interesting about this set is the multiple mentions of [[fate]] — as if it was fate that brought the troupe together, and fate that led them to storm mondstadt, and even fate that led them to fail & ultimately disband. 

their uprising is often referred to as a failure, because it didn't have a happy or triumphant ending and it didn't, in the moment, achieve what they wanted it to achieve. but we know that the [[dawnlight swordswoman]] inspired [[ragnvindr]] to join the later rebellion, and [[kreuzlied]] went on to establish the [[underground organization]] that aided in that rebellion & is still operating today. and when you think about the ripple effect of all of that, it does seem a bit like fate.

## [[notes/artifacts/flower of life|heart of comradeship]]
*"A small cerulean flower with somebody's ribbon pinned to the stem."*
> The traveler from a distant land pinned this flower close to his chest.
> 
> The traveler left a life of great privilege to pursue a wandering, unburdened life. 
> 
> In a foreign land, by a clear lake of sweet waters, he met a frowning maiden.
> 
> "A traveler from afar? ...Huh. Not like it matters."  
> "You're a musician? Well then, pray do not insult me with empty praises or song."  
> "Just remember me as I am."  
> "As one about to be offered up as a sacrifice for the 'festival.'"
> 
> The traveler who had abandoned his homeland pinned this flower close to his chest.  
> He wished to remind himself to love no one, and become attached to nothing.  
> Yet he would remember that maiden as he had promised, and walk into the fire for her sake...

the festival the woman mentions is the [[ludi harpastum]] festival, during a time when the [[lawrence clan]] was using the event for their own amusement.

the "homeland" that the sojourner abandoned was [[fontaine]]. (i really hope fontaine gives us a better idea of what his life might have been like pre-[[wanderers’ troupe]] — why did he leave his life of "great privilege"? was it his choice?)

## [[notes/artifacts/plume of death|feather of homecoming]]
*"A blue arrow fletching imbued with the sentiment of travelers that had once faded into the horizon."*
> Hope was ripped to shreds by ruthless might, and promises of reunion disappeared like fleeting shadows. 
> 
> The wandering traveler had once against lost a place to call home.
> 
> The condescending evil stole his love's joy,  
> And the endless conflict ground down his irreverent soul.  
> Those gentle, playful rhythms of revelry,  
> Now turned to sharp, icy clangs.
> 
> For his comrades, for his best friend, for the tables around which none would again share wine.  
> For freedom, for life, and for revenge against the evil that had taken her smile.  
> Thus resolved, the traveler plucked his last string, and fired his final arrow.
> 
> As he grew accustomed to life in this foreign land, he gazed up at the azure sky.  
> Ah, so the sky here was the same as the one back in his homeland...

after the sojourner fell in love with the woman by the lake, the [[wanderers’ troupe]] attempted to storm mondstadt & start an uprising against the aristocracy — but they failed, and soon after "disbanded." the [wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wanderer%27s_Troupe_(Faction)) claims that the sojourner was killed in the uprising, but that doesn't seem true to me since this mentions that he "grew accustomed to life in this foreign land" *after* the mention of the uprising. (that said, i've noticed that artifact lore is not always linear & "losing a place to call home" is a little at odds with "growing accustomed to life in this foreign land.")  

it's also unclear what the fate of the woman was — she could have been killed in the uprising, but this only mentions that they "stole his love's joy" and "had taken her smile," so it's possible she lived, albeit unhappily. 

*also*: who was his "best friend"? what is the significance of his "final arrow"? lots that i'm still curious about.

## [[notes/artifacts/sands of eon|sundial of the sojourner]]
*"A sundial that has survived the ages, always silently recording the cycles of the [[notes/sun|sun]] and [[notes/moon|moon]] as they pass through the sky."*
> The traveler pursued both [[fate]] and the inexorable passage of [[time]].  
> 
> The troupe that resisted the aristocracy — and their end — could be seen in the eternal flow of time.
> 
> In the course of a long journey, even the most well-made watch might cease to work.  
> The only unfailing marker of time was the passage of the [[notes/sun|sun]] and [[notes/moon|moon]].  
> So to chase formless time, the traveler could only pursue [[light]] itself.
> 
> The great halls of the nobility, and the rebellious troupe with no room to lay their heads.  
> Both were churned just the same by the flow of time, and both like fleeting [[dreams]] raced towards the same destruction.
> 
> Under the moonless night sky, the dark shadows drew upon the outlander's tired face.  
> "The songs are spent like arrows few, to the choir the curtain calls."  
> "Shall I ever see you smile anew, when the tower in the city square falls?"

again, i think the mention of "their end" here isn't necessarily referring to the deaths of the [[wanderers’ troupe]], just the fact that they disbanded after the failed uprising. 

"when the tower in the city square falls" is probably refering to the tower the [[lawrence clan]] built in the plaza, which is where the chosen woman ("sacrifice") would throw the [[ludi harpastum]] ball from. (according to the [wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Ludi_Harpastum?so=search), "Venti surmises it was for the maiden's safety due to the crowds" — my guess is it was more to trap her there.) 

this description is one of my favorites; it's so beautiful. *"So to chase formless time, the traveler could only pursue light itself"* is insane. & the part about the nobility and the troupe *both* "racing towards the same destruction" is so cool — maybe the uprising failed, but maybe it did all it was supposed to do. maybe it was destined to happen like this. 

## [[notes/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|goblet of the sojourner]]
*"A plain porcelain goblet that was once brimming with joyous brews."*
> A lyre has 4 strings.  
> 
> The days he spent with his comrades in the "troupe" were probably the happiest in his life of wandering.  
> At first, it was just a chance meeting with the conductor — but for the invisible strings of [[fate]]. 
> First came the girl who used a flute as a sword, and then that fellow Kreuzlied — one by one, the traveler met them all.
> 
> In the joyous tavern, the lyrist introduced a maiden he had met by chance to his comrades amidst the singing and dancing.  
> The drunken traveler strummed the strings and sang in a loud voice.
> 
> With them by his side, he would never have to travel alone again...  
> Perhaps it would be alright to walk with them till journey's end.

the [[wanderers’ troupe]] had four members, clearly represented by the four lyre strings here. the other three members of the troupe are mentioned here — i'm not sure where the members all met, given that they must have been traveling for a while before their disbandment, since it's mentioned they went to [[mare jivari]] together. 

mentioning the strings of fate here is interesting to me — this is the second time fate is mentioned, the first being in the **sundial of the sojourner** description. if it *was* their fate for all four of them to meet and form the troupe, was the uprising also part of that fate? was the uprising *failing* also part of that fate? 

## [[notes/artifacts/circlet of logos|crown of parting]]
*"A reed coronet that emanates the spring breeze."*
> The departing traveler would take this crown of willow branches as a final memento.  
> With it, he would remember his lover, now departed like a dandelion on the breeze.
> 
> The traveler was the wandering lyrist, and that maiden in the country of wine was a prisoner of the nobility.  
> For reasons he knew not himself, his lyre-song revealed his true heart.
> 
> "What would move me, you ask? ...Well, it would be your smile."  
> "I've never known you to smile, after all. Not even once."  
> "I will break the chains that bind you."  
> "When that time comes, would you let me see you smile?"
> 
> "Yes, and thank you. It would be wonderful indeed if you could do that."  
> Pretty words, but who could trust them, coming from a singer?

whew! the last line is a lot. clearly the woman never expected him to be succesful — or maybe never expected him to actually *try* to "break the chains." 

this also mentions that she "departed like a dandelion on the breeze," which might mean that she *did* die, either during the uprising or in the aftermath of it. 

i find it interesting that he says he's never seen her smile even once, when in the **feather of homecoming** description it says that "evil" had "taken her smile."
