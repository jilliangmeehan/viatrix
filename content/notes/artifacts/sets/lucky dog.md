title: "lucky dog"

i don't have any guesses as to who this artifact series is about, but it reminds me a lot of [[bennett]] — except bennett is obviously known to be very *unlucky.* 

the part that says "Lucky Dog had no family, let alone children of his own. But in the course of his life of good fortune, he considered all he met as his friends and family." also makes me think of bennett & the way he calls all the men of the [[Adventurers' Guild]] his "dads." 

since it's explicitly mentioned that he had no family or children, i guess it's unlikely that bennett is actually related to him — but since we *also* don't know where the hell bennett came from, i don't think it's *impossible.* 

**another fun note:** the german name for this set is "Glückspilz" which translates to "Lucky Mushroom" — apparently this is a colloqial term for a lucky person, based on the fact that mushrooms are symbols of good luck in germany.

## [[notes/artifacts/flower of life|lucky dog's clover]]
*"A four-leaf clover that grows in the wild. It was picked because it is said to bring good luck."*
> One who is favored by fortune tends to experience at least their fair share of miracles.

## [[notes/artifacts/plume of death|lucky dog's eagle feather]]
*"A monster once cornered an adventurer, but was then picked off by a hunting [[eagle]]... That eagle dropped this feather, which now carries some of the adventurer's good luck."*
> When fortune has your back, even the most ferocious monster has to yield.  
> 
> Strolling in the forest, the boy known as Lucky Dog had no idea that a monster was lurking nearby, having singled him out as its prey.  
> 
> The boy became distracted by some colorful mushrooms, and the monster pounced. He leaped out and landed on the poisonous mushrooms, stomping them flat.  
> 
> This was going to be an easy hunt, the monster thought — until a feather from the eagle circling above fell quietly onto its back.

## [[notes/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|lucky dog's hourglass]]
*"A broken hourglass from which all the sand has escaped. But it's fine, because the passage of time means nothing to someone without a single worry in the whole world."*
> Even time itself could not leave a wrinkle on the face of the happy-go-lucky boy known as Lucky Dog.  
> 
> Lucky Dog had no family, let alone children of his own.  
> 
> But in the course of his life of good fortune, he considered all he met as his friends and family.  
> 
> As his life was nearing its end, he saw an hourglass with sand flowing down, as if counting down his remaining time.  
> 
> He simply chuckled, took a slingshot, and shattered the hourglass.

## [[notes/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|lucky dog's goblet]]
*"An exquisite metallic vessel that was once used to knock out a thief."*
> Once there was a child favored by fortune from the day he was born.  
> 
> Try as they might, even the most vicious bandits could not lay a finger on him. He became known as Lucky Dog.  
> 
> The child grew up, and one day in the throes of adulthood he found himself stumbling drunk along the back alley behind the tavern.  
> 
> Under the starless sky, a vicious bandit prepared to rob Lucky Dog, taking advantage of his compromised state.  
> 
> But just as the bandit was about to strike, a flying goblet hit him square on the forehead, knocking him out cold.  
> 
> Naturally, this makes Lucky Dog one of very few people known to have benefited, rather than suffered, from being in the vicinity of a tavern brawl.

## [[notes/artifacts/circlet of logos|lucky dog's silver circlet]]
*"Its former owner once fell into a cave and found the treasure trove of an exiled royal. This is a souvenir from that incident."*
> One who is favored by fortune can find priceless treasures in the most deadly of traps.  
> 
> While wandering around some ruins, the boy known as Lucky Dog accidentally fell into a deep pit.
> 
> He landed safely on a pile of dust. It turned out to be a mattress that over the years had gradually broken down, eventually turning to dust.  
> 
> Just like that, Lucky Dog discovered a treasure trove left by the old aristocrats. This circlet came to epitomize his luck.

we don't know who "lucky dog" is, where he's from, or what time period he lived in. but this sounds like it could be referring to [[parcifal]], an "exiled" descendent of the [[lawrence clan]] — "old aristocrats" in mondstadt who have ties to the [[royal series]] of weapons.
