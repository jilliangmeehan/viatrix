title: "berserker"

we don't know who the berserker is, where his homeland was, what time period he lived in, or much of what happened to him. what we *do* know is that his home was destroyed by flames, caused by a war with the gods, and it turned him into a bloodthirsty fighter. 

there are a few mentions of birds — specifically [[raven|ravens]] — and bird feathers in here. also lots of stuff about [[masks]]. this story also reminds me a lot of [[childe]], his fall into the [[abyss]], and the effect that it had on him. i haven't really decided what i think it all means yet, but it's cool.

## [[notes/artifacts/flower of life|berserker's rose]]
*"An exquisite flower that has been dyed red. It represents the qualities of the Berserker."*
> In the days before the berserker descended into madness, he would sometimes pause in the [[content/notes/rose|rose]] garden for a moment to himself.  
> 
> He had never had a family, nor had he a lover, or a friend.  
> 
> When he was not on the battlefield, he would come here to tend to the fragile flowers in the garden with all his heart, as if the crimson flowers buried in the thorns were the only warmth he could cling to.

## [[notes/artifacts/plume of death|berserker's indigo feather]]
*"An indigo feather from a legendary [[raven]], part of which has been dyed crimson red."*
> The once-sane berserker's homeland fell victim to the raging war between gods and mortals.  
> 
> The [[content/notes/rose|rose]] garden burst into flames and [[birds]] of omen fed on the flesh of his countrymen.  
> 
> Reborn in flames, vengeance and bloodlust took over the warrior's mind, turning him into a berserker.  
> 
> Black feathers, scattered on the battlefield, were painted red by his rage as he took his revenge.

we don't know where the berserker's homeland was — could have been anywhere, considering how many times ancient civilizations have been destroyed by the gods.

## [[notes/artifacts/sands of eon|berserker's timepiece]]
*"An instrument with an eternal flow that continues mercilessly within, reminding the Berserker of the limited time he has left — both on the battlefield as well as in the world."*
> The end inevitably comes for all, even the seemingly invincible berserker.  
> 
> As the blood on his hands finally dried up, the berserker's footsteps began to falter.  
> 
> His life was [[destined]] to end the moment he met his last challenge in the battlefield.  
> 
> On the battlefield where blood flowed like rivers, his hourglass was painted red by the setting [[content/notes/sun]].

what was "his last challenge" and why did that, specifically, make his life "destined to end"? was it the monster mentioned in the **bone goblet** description below, or something more metaphorical? 

## [[notes/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|berserker's bone goblet]]
*"A goblet made from the bone of an unknown beast. It was taken as a trophy after some deadly encounter."*
> The bloodthirsty berserker ravaged the lands, fighting humans and monsters alike, and even challenged the gods.  
> 
> In a barren and lifeless land, he encountered a giant monster.  
> 
> His iron [[mask]] could not conceal his rage, and so an endless fight ensued.  
> 
> Hours, days, and years passed. The monster was finally defeated.  
> 
> The berserker sucked out the marrow of the monster's broken horn. This was how the victor drank to his success.

this reminds me a lot of [[childe]]’s lore. maybe the "barren and lifeless land" was his destroyed homeland, or maybe it was the abyss. maybe the giant monster he encountered was the same one childe fought (or similar). "hours, days, and years passed" also seems related to the way time is warped in the abyss — childe was there for months, but only three days had passed in teyvat. 

returning to what i said above about the **berserker's timepiece**: he successfully defeated this monster, but could this still have been his "last challenge"? 

## [[notes/artifacts/circlet of logos|berserker's battle mask]]
*"A hideous iron mask that has been left half-shattered from vicious battles."*
> Bathed in the flames that devoured his homeland, the berserker's face was no longer recognizable.  
> 
> The iron [[mask]] became joined with his flesh, permanently branding his face with a heartless countenance.  
> 
> Then, in a fierce battle, his horrifying mask was split into two by his opponent.  
> 
> The cracks of the mask tore apart the flesh that had long stuck to it.  
> 
> But neither pain nor blood could stop the berserker's unfaltering footsteps.  
> 
> The berserker kept roaring until the fresh blood covered the black clots hardened on his face.

some very cool & gruesome imagery here of the broken mask literally becoming part of his face and ripping it apart. gross.

as far as i know, there are no other masks in the game that look like the berserker's mask — i haven't been able to match it up with anything. most of the masks we see completely cover up the wearer's eyes, but this one leaves them quite uncovered, which is interesting. 

also: despite the mask being split in two, it did still stay on his face, so there's no *obvious* connection to any of the other half-mask situations ([[dainsleif]], [[pierro]]) & therefore no *obvious* connection to [[khaenri'ah]]. it does have the two little spikes/horns on the side that some of [[the black serpents]] have on their masks, but otherwise doesn't have much resemblance.
