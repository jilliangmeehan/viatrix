a lot of my thoughts & explanations on eons are [[notes/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|over here]], where i wrote about the "goblet of eonothem." tl;dr an *eonothem* refers to the huge layer of rock that covers the earth during a period of time, while an *eon* refers to the period of time itself. 

*eons* pretty clearly represent the passage of [[time]], so it makes sense that it would be used as the title for pieces like hourglasses, watches, and other timepieces. many of these pieces have stories about people running out of time, a theme we encounter a lot throughout the game.
