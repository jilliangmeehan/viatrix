## what's an eonothem?
according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eonothem), an *eonothem* is "the totality of rock strata laid down during a certain eon of the geologic timescale," but i barely understand what that means. essentially (as far as i can tell), the term refers to the huge layer of rock that covers the earth during an "eon." *eons* and their *eonothems* are referred to by the same name, but the *eonothem* is referring specifically to the rock, rather than the time period.

more from wikipedia:
> Eonothems have the same names as their corresponding eons, which means during the [history of the Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Earth "History of the Earth") only four eonothems were formed. Oldest to newest these are the [Hadean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean "Hadean"), [Archean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean "Archean"), [Proterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic "Proterozoic"), and [Phanerozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic "Phanerozoic").

those first two, "hadean" and "archean," sound pretty interesting to me.

### hadean
here's the etymology of the "hadean" eon / eonothem, via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean):
> "Hadean" (from [Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades "Hades"), the Greek god of the underworld, and the underworld itself) describes the [hellish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell "Hell") conditions then prevailing on Earth: the planet had just formed and was still very hot owing to its recent [accretion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(astrophysics) "Accretion (astrophysics)"), the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements, and frequent collisions with other Solar System bodies.

that reminds me a lot of [[notes/01 - timeline|the old world]], before the era of archons in teyvat. the reference to the underworld is just a fun bonus.

### archean
then we have the "archean" eon, which obviously brings to mind the archons of teyvat — and i think it definitely makes sense to look at this period of time in teyvat as a second "eon," following the period before the archon war. 

as for the etymology of "archean," via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean):
> The word _Archean_ comes from the Greek word _arkhē_ ([αρχή](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%AE#Ancient_Greek "wikt:αρχή")), meaning 'beginning, origin'.

another thing i think is interesting:
> The [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth") during the Archean was mostly a water world: there was [continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust "Continental crust"), but much of it was under an ocean deeper than today's ocean.

we're starting to get more and more hints about teyvat's ocean — i definitely believe that there's a lot underwater that we haven't even heard about yet. not to mention [[enkanomiya]].

## ok so what does it mean?
i don't know why they chose the goblet, specifically, as a symbol of eonothems. maybe it's linked to the [tarot suit of cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_of_goblets), which pertains to emotions, intuition, spirituality, and water. or maybe it's referencing the [holy grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail), symbolizing healing & infinite sustenance. idk!

what i *do* know is the choice to call it the "goblet of eonothem" rather than the "goblet of eon" was deliberate — and the same goes for the [[notes/artifacts/sands of eon]]. these pieces represent different, but related things; while the sands go hand-in-hand with the passage of time, the goblet represents something more physical. 

the different eons of teyvat are important (especially the insinuation that there is another, perhaps post-archon eon coming later) but with the goblet, we're more focused on the layer of rock that buries teyvat's histories underground. we've seen & heard of plenty of ancient civilizations by now that used to live on the surface, but are now deep underground. and it will continue to happen, because that's the nature of the world.

i'm still trying to figure out what *exactly* a goblet has to do with all that, but we'll get there.
