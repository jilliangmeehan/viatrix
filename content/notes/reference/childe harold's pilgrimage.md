[childe harold's pilgrimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childe_Harold%27s_Pilgrimage?useskin=vector) is a narrative poem by lord byron that i think relates to [[notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]]. i'm still making my way through it, so i don't have any grand analysis or anything — but i wanted to keep track of some interesting excerpts here.

canto the first, vi:
> Apart he stalked in joyless reverie,
> 
> And from his native land resolved to go,
> 
> And visit scorching climes beyond the sea;
> 
> With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,
> 
> And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.

wanting to leave home so badly he'd seek out the abyss. maybe the abyss was calling to him his whole life.

canto the first, viii:
> Yet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood,
> 
> Strange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,
> 
> As if the memory of some deadly feud
> 
> Or disappointed passion lurked below:
> 
> But this none knew, nor haply cared to know;
> 
> For his was not that open, artless soul
> 
> That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow;
> 
> Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole,
> 
> Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.”

foul legacy & the traces of the abyss lurking inside him.

canto the first, xiii:
> And now I'm in the world alone,
> 
> Upon the wide, wide sea;
> 
> But why should I for others groan,
> 
> When none will sigh for me?

childe harold has set out on the sea and is wishing his homeland goodnight. one fundamental difference between childe harold and our childe is that our childe *knows* he is loved and missed by his family, whereas childe harold fears that he's not leaving behind anyone who cares about him.

canto the first, xxvii:
> His early youth misspent in maddest whim;
> 
> But as he gazed on Truth, his aching eyes grew dim.

this seems to basically be about childe harold traveling around and contemplating what he sees in other nations.

canto the first, lxii:
> Happier in this than mightiest bards have been,
> 
> Whose fate to distant homes confined their lot,
> 
> Shall I unmoved behold the hallowed scene,
> 
> Which others rave of, though they know it not?
> 
> Though here no more Apollo haunts his grot,
> 
> And thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,
> 
> Some gentle spirit still pervades the spot,
> 
> Sighs in the gale, keeps silence in the cave,
> 
> And glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.

here, he's talking about mount parnassus. (truly nothing to say about this, just thought it was a cool passage.)

canto the first, lxxxii:
> Oh! many a time and oft had Harold loved,
> 
> Or dreamed he loved, since rapture is a dream;
> 
> But now his wayward bosom was unmoved,
> 
> For not yet had he drunk of Lethe's stream:
> 
> And lately had he learned with truth to deem
> 
> Love has no gift so grateful as his wings:
> 
> How fair, how young, how soft soe'er he seem,
> 
> Full from the fount of joy's delicious springs
> 
> Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings.

i can barely decipher what this means, but i do know the [river lethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe?useskin=vector): the river of forgetfulness in the greek underworld. drinking from the river causes complete forgetfulness — apparently shades of the dead were required to drink from the river and leave their memories behind in order to be reincarnated.

canto the first, lxxxiv, to inez:
> And dost thou ask what secret woe
> 
> I bear, corroding joy and youth?
> 
> And wilt thou vainly seek to know
> 
> A pang even thou must fail to soothe?

> It is not love, it is not hate,
> 
> Nor low Ambition's honours lost,
> 
> That bids me loathe my present state,
> 
> And fly from all I prized the most:

> It is that weariness which springs
> 
> From all I meet, or hear, or see:
> 
> To me no pleasure Beauty brings;
> 
> Thine eyes have scarce a charm for me.

what's his secret? he's tired.
