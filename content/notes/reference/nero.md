i've been learning a bit about [nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero?useskin=vector) recently & there are just so many interesting things that remind me of both [[rex lapis]] and [[king deshret]]:
- [the golden house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Aurea?useskin=vector) !!!
- [[notes/reference/motifs/memory|damnatio memoriae]]
- seeing himself as a [[notes/reference/motifs/sun|sun]] god — deshret & rex lapis both lean quite heavily on the sun imagery
- the way he kinda went crazy & ended up with a horrible reputation, but was supposedly loved by his people 
- his love for architecture & the arts
- the once-held [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Redivivus_legend?useskin=vector) that he would return (possibly as the antichrist?) after his death, or that he was actually still alive
