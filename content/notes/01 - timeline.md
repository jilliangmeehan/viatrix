this is a very work-in-progress overview of the timeline & history of teyvat — as far as we know it, i guess. most of this is pulled from the [wiki](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline), so if you're looking for something more comprehensive, that's the place to go.

much of the genshin timeline is still very speculative. we don't really know for sure when certain things happened or what the exact order of events was. but i'm hoping that laying it all out here will help me start to make some sense of it.

## the old world: ~6k years ago
* the seven nations were ruled by [[the seven sovereigns]] — primordial dragons from the [[notes/places/realms|vishap realm]]
* [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] ("eternal throne of the heavens") appeared along with its [[notes/characters/the four shades|"four shining shades of itself"]] & challenged [[the seven sovereigns]]
* **40 years after** [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] appeared, [[the seven sovereigns]] were defeated & escaped to the ocean — [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] created heaven and earth "for the sake of humanity" (the [[notes/places/realms|human realm]])

## the new world
### the ark's opening
- **400 years later** [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] + [[notes/characters/the four shades|the four shades]] finished creating the [[notes/places/realms|human realm]] and filling it with animals
- [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] creatd a "sacred plan" for humanity; humanity tended to the land & everything went well = "the year of jubilee"
- the whole world was inhabited by [[notes/characters/seelies|seelies]] ("beautiful, humanoid forms" with "great wisdom" that were "tasked with guiding humanity" — "they built a large and prosperous civilization and erected large palaces")
### second throne of the heavens
- **? years later** [[the second who came]] appeared and waged war against [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]], resulting in the destruction of the heavens and earth
- fall of the [[notes/characters/seelies|seelies]]
- fall of the [[notes/characters/three moon sisters|three moon sisters]]
- [[notes/places/enkanomiya|enkanomiya]] fell into the ocean
- **after the war** "whoever emerged victorious" took control of the heavens + "forbade knowledge" of history before the war — the people of [[notes/places/enkanomiya|enkanomiya]] believed [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] won, but apparently it's unknown
- supposedly [[rex lapis]] was alive + very young at this time

> [!NOTE]
> the exact chain of events here is unclear to me — how long was the second who came in this world before the disaster? was the disaster caused by the failed changing of the moons, or was that a result of the war?
