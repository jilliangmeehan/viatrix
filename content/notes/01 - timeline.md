## the old world: ~6k years ago
* the seven nations were ruled by [[the seven sovereigns]] — primordial dragons from the [[notes/places/realms|vishap realm]]
* [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] ("eternal throne of the heavens") appeared along with its [[notes/characters/the four shades|"four shining shades of itself"]] & challenged [[the seven sovereigns]]
* **40 years after** [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] appeared, [[the seven sovereigns]] were defeated & escaped to the ocean — [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] created heaven and earth "for the sake of humanity" (the [[notes/places/realms|human realm]])

## the new world
### the ark's opening
- **400 years later** [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] + [[notes/characters/the four shades|the four shades]] finished creating the [[notes/places/realms|human realm]] and filling it with animals
- [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] creatd a "sacred plan" for humanity; humanity tended to the land & everything went well = "the year of jubilee"
- the whole world was inhabited by [[notes/characters/seelies|seelies]] ("beautiful, humanoid forms" with "great wisdom" that were "tasked with guiding humanity" — "they built a large and prosperous civilization and erected large palaces")
### second throne of the heavens
- **? years later** [[the second who came]] appeared and waged war against [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]], resulting in the destruction of the heavens and earth
- fall of the [[notes/characters/seelies|seelies]]
- fall of the [[notes/characters/three moon sisters|three moon sisters]]
- [[enkanomiya]] fell into the ocean
- **after the war** "whoever emerged victorious" took control of the heavens + "forbade knowledge" of history before the war — the people of [[enkanomiya]] believed [[notes/characters/the primordial one|the primordial one]] won, but apparently it's unknown
- supposedly [[rex lapis]] was alive + very young at this time

> [!NOTE]
> the exact chain of events here is unclear to me — how long was the second who came in this world before the disaster? was the disaster caused by the failed changing of the moons, or was that a result of the war?
