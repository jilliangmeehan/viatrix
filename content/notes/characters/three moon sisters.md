title: "three moon sisters"
draft: false

* aria, sonnet, and canon
* lived in [[the lunar palace]]
* changed places 3x a month to ride around the heavens in a silver carriage; failure to switch places would result in disaster

> [!NOTE]
> i read a note on the wiki somewhere that said there's a mistranslation here — apparently the original chinese text makes it sound more like a failure to switch places would only be *caused* by a disaster, rather than the other way around.

## fall of the three moon sisters
- the three moon sisters saw what happened to the [[notes/characters/seelies]] & "mourned their fate" —  their silver carriage was "overturned" while the "hall of stars" was destroyed
- the sisters turned on & killed each other — two of their corpses crumbled away, leaving one that is now the solitary moon
- the "solar chariot" fell into [[the chasm]], where a later civilization there repaired it & returned it to the sky
- the wolves in teyvat still mourn the moon sisters
- the lost civilization that created the [[spiral abyss]] is connected to the moon sisters
