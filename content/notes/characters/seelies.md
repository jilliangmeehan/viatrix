## fall of the seelies
- a seelie ancestor fell in love with "a traveler from afar" (likely [[the second who came]]) & they pledged their union in [[the lunar palace]] 30 days before a "disaster" — they attempted to flee, but were punished by the heavens with eternal separation and a curse that took away their memories

> i'm a little unclear on the order of operations here. my original notes say the "disaster" was presumably caused by a failed changing of the moons, but it seems more likely that the failed changing of the moons was caused *by* this "disaster," which i'm assuming is the war btwn the primordial one + the second who came. did the second who came initiate a war against the primordial one — or did the primordial one seek to separate the couple first, leading to war?

- the rest of the seelie civilization withered away due to grief
- they have all been cursed to forget their past & are still pursuing their memories by guiding travelers to seelie courts
- apparently a few seelie didn't wither away — a wolf-king (maybe [[andrius]]) met a still-humanoid seelie and befriended her; might be the "ancient god" he got his power from
