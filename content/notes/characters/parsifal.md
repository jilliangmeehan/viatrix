## tl;dr
* mondstadt aristocrat from 1000 years ago, heir to the landrich family
* two brothers: eberhart (illegitimate heir) & ingbert (legitimate heir)
* parcifal became a “phantom thief” and stole from the aristocracy to give to the poor etc
* “His chivalric nature and desire for justice, egged on by Eberhart,[^ ]led him to become a vigilante who targeted his fellow aristocrats. Eberhart would eventually turn on him, forcing him to flee to [Liyue](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Liyue) in disgrace. He joined the Skipper's crew and eventually met his end in battle against the sea monster that the Skipper sought to take revenge on.” — the heart of depth artifact set tells the story of his travels with the skipper (as a bonus: HoD is from the dragonspine domain & [[content/notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]] has some weird connections with dragonspine lol)
* the exile set might also be about parsifal but it gets a little muddy. first, it’s unclear if parsifal was exiled from mondstadt or if just chose to leave. second, the exile’s goblet was a family heirloom of the exile & it says he carved out the gem himself, whereas all the other parsifal lore says *he* carved out the sapphire of a goblet he stole from some noble house. who knows! could be another exiled aristocrat, but a lot of the details do seem to match up.

## blue-eyed spear witch
* some time while parsifal was in mondstadt, he met the **blue-eyed spear witch**—who was a servant for an aristocratic family at the time
* “he was leaving a mansion with stolen goods and noticed a woman in a window whose eyes were as blue as the gem in the silver cup he had just stolen. Struck by her beauty, he climbed up to her, pried the blue gem out of the silver cup and gave it to her as a gift.”
* “Unfortunately, this blue gem had the crest of the ruling family on it, and when the woman's master found out she had it, she was punished, which caused her to become angry at Parsifal despite still being in love with him.[^ ]The next time they met she warned that someday she would pay him back for the scars inflicted on her due to his actions,[^ ]and they seemingly never met again.”
* at some point before leaving mondstadt, parsifal stopped at the shop in heart’s desire (sapphire) to buy “the special wine that helps you forget about the one you long for” but it has already been purchased by the blue-eyed spear witch, who exchanged the sapphire he gave her for the wine
* the wine and song catalyst description tells the story of them meeting but gives them a happy ending where they went to explore the world together—“For no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.”
* supposedly, eberhart was trained by the blue-eyed spear witch after parsifal left mondstadt & later killed her—i don’t think it explicitly says anywhere that she died, but it’s heavily implied in the crescent pike weapon description
* one other thing that i’m still not sure about that swirls around in my head a lot is the hex and hound book, which is about two shapeshifting sisters, one of which has blue eyes. i think it’s possible this is the blue-eyed spear witch, and if *that’s* true i think it’s possible she survived.

## eberhart
* half-brother of parsifal & ingbert, resented his noble lineage & wanted to “recapture the glory and pride of ancient nobility” and “destroy these rotten foundations” (via: favonius lance)
* he was the owner of the unnamed gladiator that was killed by vennessa from the gladiator artifact set (to give you a sense of the timeline)
* went on an expedition to dragonspine with ingbert & and a few other aristocrats—on this expedition, he laid traps & killed the others. he was supposedly gravely wounded, and we’re not sure if he lived / made it back to mondstadt
* became the blue-eyed spear witch’s disciple (knowing she was in love with parsifal) “to learn the fatal loophole in her art, all the better to slay her with…” & killed her (via: favonius lance)
* “So what if those who came after should despise me? I will do anything to achieve my goals.” (via: favonius lance)


## parsifal / parzival
* parsifal is an opera by wagner based on the arthurian story parzival that was written about a character named percival. are we taking notes.
  * apparently it was the last opera he ever wrote?
  * important to note: genshin *loves* wagner. they are obsessed with this guy. 
  * wagner, probably more than anyone, is known for having a lot of letimotifs in his work (similar to the genshin ost lol!)
* percival was one of the knights of the round table in arthurian legend, and was the original hero in the quest for the holy grail (before later being replaced by galahad)
* to be honest, the story of percival doesn’t seem to have a ton in common with genshin’s parsifal—percival comes across the fisher king, who is wounded. if he asks the king a particular “healing question,” he can heal the king & save his kingdom & get the holy grail etc—but he doesn’t know this, so he doesn’t ask the question.
* in most versions, percival’s mother hides him in the woods when he’s born because she doesn’t want him to become a knight like his father or something, but then 3 knights come across them and i guess he thinks they’re so cool he wants to be a knight too. he leaves & his mother usually dies due to grief.
* in **parzival**, his story continues past that initial failure & leads to him becoming the grail king. one interesting thing in this version is that the fisher king gets a name, anfortas, which is also the name of the leader of the schwanenritter (swan knights) in khaenri’ah. 
* the opera version is called **parsifal** “informed by one of the theories about the name percival, according to which it is of persian origin, meaning ‘pure (or poor) fool’”—whenever the word fool comes up i obviously think of the fatui
  * in this version, the fisher king (now named amfortas) was stabbed with the holy spear, and it basically turns out that parsifal is fated to find the spear & heal his wound. this version also gives more of a backstory to his injury—amfortas had the holy spear, but lost it & was stabbed with it in battle because he got distracted by a pretty lady.
  * there is a LOT going on in this opera & it’s all really cool and definitely shares themes with genshin but it’s too much to get into right now


## lohengrin
* good news, the parzival character also shows up in ANOTHER wagner opera called lohengrin, which is based on the story lohengrin, which is a sequel to parzival. isn’t this fun.
* lohengrin is the son of parzival, and he is “a grail knight sent in a boat pulled by swans to rescue a maiden who can never ask his identity”—this is basically just a variation of the classic knight of the swan story (this is where we tie back into the melusine stuff). in one of the original swan knight stories, the name of the swan knight is helias. (sun god!)
* lohengrin’s twin brother inherits their father parzival’s land while lohengrin is sent out as a grail knight “in secret” to help kingdoms that have lost their protectors. he shows up in a kingdom without a male heir & offers marry the duchess there & defend the kingdom, on the condition that she must never ask his name. all is good for a few years, but then she asks the question & he gets right back on his swan boat and never returns.
* in the opera, the reason lohengrin shows up & has to defend the duchess is because she’s being wrongfully accused of murdering her brother—in the end, it turns out the swan from the swan boat is her brother, who was cursed by a witch lol

## irish myth stuff
* “There are possible parallels in *Perceval* with the Irish mythological race of the [Tuatha Dé Danann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann). The race has three central talismans, a spear, a cauldron, and a sword, that correlate with the spear, grail, and sword present in *Perceval*.[^ ]Chrétien's *Perceval* also includes many similarities to the Irish saga *[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boyhood_Deeds_of_Fionn)*. The main character, [Fionn mac Cumhaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill), is raised in isolation and undergoes many adventures akin to those of Perceval, suggesting that the narrative may have been a source of inspiration for Chrétien.”
* without getting too in the weeds here because this is all a story for another day, i have a suspicion that fontaine is going to incorporate a lot of stuff from irish mythology. especially that last character, fionn.
* for now, just know that irish mythology is divided into four cycles: the mythological cycle, the ulster cycle, the fianna cycle, and the kings’ cycle
* the ulster cycle in particular is mostly about a hero named cu chulainn, who manymanymany people have speculated was a source of inspiration for [[content/notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]]
  * cu chulainn was trained by a warrior woman named scathach (possibly skirk!) who gave him his spear, gae bulg—the description of the spear is honestly not too far off from [[content/notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]]’s hydro weapons—and he basically becomes this insane hero at a young age who turns into “an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe” when fights (like literally, that is not a metaphor, he becomes a monster. very foul legacy of him.)

## childe
* this is farfetched, but i basically have a theory that [[content/notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]] is somehow a distant descendant of parsifal and the blue-eyed spear witch—the resemblance of the heart of depth guy, the fact that he uses the freedom talent books from mondstadt, the dead blue eyes
* let it be known that i had this theory first but ashikai has a pretty good video about it that i think will cover everything quicker & more efficiently than i can: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPUcllAoxFo&pp=ygUOYXNoaWthaSBjaGlsZGU%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPUcllAoxFo&pp=ygUOYXNoaWthaSBjaGlsZGU%3D)
* ONE OTHER THING: [[content/notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]] has a bunch of ties to dragonspine, which relates to both parsifal and eberhart for obvious reasons. cihlde is shown in dragonspine in one of his character videos, durin’s corrupted heart being there reminds me a lot of whatever is going on with [[content/notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]] re: foul legacy & the abyss, and for some reason the battle music in dragonspine is [all-conquering tide](https://open.spotify.com/track/5BVQORtwCg5PtOUG5GR9B5?si=be8e6c36e63145c2) (a song that’s pretty clearly associated with [[content/notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]], was in the domain in his story quest, and is not even on the dragonspine album)
