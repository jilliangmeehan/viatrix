sometimes the plume of death is a feather that has been plucked from or dropped by a bird, and sometimes it's taken from an arrow. sometimes the feather is being worn as an accessory of some kind, usually to signify strength.

feathers (and birds, for that matter) often symbolize freedom — so it's interesting to me that this piece is called the "plume of death."
