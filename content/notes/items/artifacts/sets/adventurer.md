## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/flower of life|adventurer's flower]]
*"A resilient flower that survived the harsh environment of [[an ancient city]]. It is now proudly worn like a medal."*
> The ambitious adventurer came across this resilient flower in the depths of a gloomy ruin.  
> 
> Moved by the sight of life sprouting in defiance of a lifeless land, he almost forgot about the treasures buried deep in the ruin. 
> 
> After pausing to ponder it for a while, the adventurer plucked the flower, wore it as a brooch, and ventured forth into the darkness.

this could be about any ancient civilization — and it doesn't really matter, because the adventurer has clearly traveled all over the place. but "harsh environment" does make me think of [[sal vindagnyr]].

## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/plume of death|adventurer's tail feather]]
*"The feather of an exotic bird rarely seen on this continent."*
> An adventurer once traveled through a forest in search of rare beasts never seen before.  
> 
> As he tore his way recklessly through the foliage, the adventurer tripped on a tree root. 
> 
> When he regained consciousness, he saw a girl so beautiful that he was willing to give up the adventurer's life to be with her.  
> 
> Her appearance was surreal, with a cluster of feathers adorning her hair.

(the feather looks like a peacock feather — what "continent" are they seen on?)

## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/sands of eon|adventurer's pocket watch]]
*"It's easy to lose track of time when you're adventuring where the [[content/notes/reference/motifs/sun|sun]] doesn't shine, whether that's the depths of the [[content/notes/places/abyss|abyss]] or the ruins of a lost city."*
> A pocket watch that once belonged to an adventurer. It was crafted by a master watchmaker with simplicity and practicality in mind, aligning with the philosophy of the [[Adventurers' Guild]].  
> 
> The adventurer spent most of his days in darkness. The rhythmic sound of its moving hands was the only proof he had of the passage of time. 
> 
> Long after he had grown accustomed to a normal life, having given up the adventurer lifestyle he once loved so dearly, this forgotten pocket watch still sat quietly in the cabinet, waiting for its next adventure.

## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|adventurer's golden goblet]]
*"The spoils of one of an adventurer's many expeditions. Though a little damaged, it is still an excellent find."*
> An old golden goblet that the adventurer used to drink water. It is said that he found it in an old ruin.  
> 
> The exterior is engraved with ancient symbols and inlaid with a faded gemstone. 
> 
> Eventually, the adventurer bid farewell to the nomadic lifestyle.  
> 
> This old golden goblet was traded in for new, shiny Mora.

## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/circlet of logos|adventurer's bandana]]
*"A cloth garment worn at the forehead. Though soaked in sweat and covered in dust, it still beams with an adventurer's pride."*
> There is nothing special about this green bandana, save that the fabric is rather robust and highly absorbent.  
> 
> Just like the bandana, its wearer was an unexceptional, ordinary person.  
> 
> But countless secrets lie hidden in the [[stars]] high up above and the [[content/notes/places/abyss|abyss]] deep down below.  
> 
> All of these things are awaiting discovery by mere mortals.
