i haven't looked into this set very much, so i have no theories about it yet. but there's a comment on [the wiki page](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Instructor) that says:
> "If I'm not mistaken the Instructor's Brooch lore is talking about a Millelith Sergeant named Fengyan. You can find him right of the teleporter on Mt. Tainheng patrolling around Yiyan temple. On your first interaction with him you can obtain an instructors brooch from him along with a story that matches the one in the lore above."

so i'm interested in checking that out at some point. the style of the cap in particular doesn't really scream millelith to me, but it also doesn't really scream mondstadt, so who knows.

*"Whenever the instructor wore this brooch, it meant there would be no training sessions that day."*
> Every student in the school knew that the strict instructor was a serious soldier.  
> 
> But every week, there would always be a day or two when the instructor would wear this yellow flower brooch on his chest.  
> 
> The smile on the instructor's face would always bring the students a sense of relief.  
> 
> For when the instructor wore the yellow flower brooch, it meant that they could take a day off and go home.  
> 
> Once his boisterous students had finally gone, the instructor would visit a silent graveyard.  
> 
> There, after a moment of silence, he would pay his respects to the familiar names carved on the tombstones.

## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/plume of death|instructor's feather accessory]]
*"Any instructor who has mastered the art of de-escalation knows to keep this accessory firmly in their grasp at all times."*
> The strict instructor once sharpened his own combat skills on the merciless battlefield.  
> 
> What he teaches the students goes beyond self-defense techniques to apply in battle.  
> 
> Moreso than attacking and defending, what he imparts to them is the skill of surviving on the front line even in the face of insurmountable odds.  
> 
> Every move and technique he demonstrates pays homage to the veterans of wars gone by.  
> 
> For it was their sacrifices that helped him become who he is today.

## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/sands of eon|instructor's pocket watch]]
*"A stopwatch used not for general timekeeping but to measure the duration of a training session."*
> A pocket watch treasured by the instructor. It is not, however, military-issue gear from the instructor's school.  
> 
> Back when the instructor was still a soldier, this pocket watch was used to coordinate charges against the enemy.  
> 
> It marked victories and defeats, and counted the final hours of the soldiers.  
> 
> For the students, it represented the hardships they endured on the long path towards becoming a real soldier.

this is one of the rare instances, i think, of a timepiece that counts *up* rather than *down.* and it has an almost positive connotation, compared to the hourglasses and watches representing people running out of time.

## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|instructor's tea cup]]
*"It may seem like an ordinary tea cup to most. But to students, it is the symbol of the instructor's authority."*
> Every military school student knows that the so-called "free training time" could not have anything less to do with freedom.  
> 
> The instructor sits back and watches while the students train rigorously in the field.  
> 
> A cup of black tea with a little too much sugar in it marks a typical afternoon for the instructor.  
> 
> This peaceful time is a privilege of the instructor, and the embodiment of his authority.

## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/circlet of logos|instructor's cap]]
*"A standard-issue honorary instructor's cap, only granted to those who turn down a promotion."*
> "I don't have the talent to command an army as its general,  
> Nor am I qualified for anything beyond being a soldier.  
> All I can do is to be a strict instructor to these children,  
> So that they might survive on the battlefield a bit longer."
