## what is this?
this is a little personal project i'm working on to keep track of my notes & thoughts about lore in genshin impact. it's not a wiki, it's not perfect or comprehensive, and it's very much a constant work in progress.

## why?
genshin impact lore is really cool & interesting to me — there are so many themes, so many [motifs](https://teyvatlore.garden/tags/motifs/), so many [references](https://teyvatlore.garden/tags/reference/) & allusions. it's hard to keep it all straight in my head without feeling a little nuts. 

i've been making lots of haphazard notes and sending incomprehensible discord messages to my friends about it all for a long time. i wanted to start keeping better track of it all in a way that's both easy to edit & easy to share.
