Struck by her beauty, he climbed up to her, pried the blue gem out of the silver cup and gave it to her as a gift.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this blue gem had the crest of the ruling family on it, and when the woman&rsquo;s master found out she had it, she was punished, which caused her to become angry at Parsifal despite still being in love with him. The next time they met she warned that someday she would pay him back for the scars inflicted on her due to his actions, and they seemingly never met again.</p></blockquote><p>at some point before leaving mondstadt, parsifal stopped at the shop in <a class="internal-link broken">heart‚Äôs desire (sapphire)</a> to buy ‚Äúthe special <a class="internal-link broken">wine</a> that helps you forget about the one you long for‚Äù but it has already been purchased by the blue-eyed spear witch, who exchanged the sapphire he gave her for the wine.</p><p>the <a class="internal-link broken">wine and song</a> catalyst description tells the story of them meeting but gives them a happy ending where they went to explore the world together‚Äî‚ÄúFor no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.‚Äù</p><p>supposedly, eberhart was trained by the blue-eyed spear witch after parsifal left mondstadt & later killed her‚Äîi don‚Äôt think it explicitly says anywhere that she died, but it‚Äôs heavily implied in the <a class="internal-link broken">crescent pike</a> weapon description</p><p>one other thing that i‚Äôm still not sure about that swirls around in my head a lot is the <a class="internal-link broken">hex and hound</a> book, which is about two shapeshifting sisters, one of which has blue eyes. i think it‚Äôs possible this is the blue-eyed spear witch, and if <em>that‚Äôs</em> true i think it‚Äôs possible she survived.</p><a href=#eberhart><h2 id=eberhart><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>eberhart</h2></a><p>eberhart was the half-brother of parsifal & ingbert‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhe resented his noble lineage & wanted to ‚Äúrecapture the glory and pride of ancient nobility‚Äù and ‚Äúdestroy these rotten foundations.‚Äù<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>he was the owner of the unnamed gladiator that was killed by <a class="internal-link broken">vennessa</a> from the <a class="internal-link broken">gladiator</a> artifact set (to give you a sense of the timeline).</p><p>he went on an expedition to <a class="internal-link broken">dragonspine</a> with ingbert & and a few other aristocrats‚Äîon this expedition, he laid traps & killed the others. he was supposedly gravely wounded, and we‚Äôre not sure if he lived / made it back to mondstadt.</p><p>later, he became the <a class="internal-link broken">blue-eyed spear witch</a>‚Äôs disciple (knowing she was in love with parsifal) ‚Äúto learn the fatal loophole in her art, all the better to slay her with‚Ä¶‚Äù & killed her<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>So what if those who came after should despise me?

<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann rel=noopener>Tuatha D√© Danann</a>. The race has three central talismans, a spear, a cauldron, and a sword, that correlate with the spear, grail, and sword present in¬†<em>Perceval</em>.[^ ]Chr√©tien&rsquo;s¬†<em>Perceval</em>¬†also includes many similarities to the Irish saga¬†<em>
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boyhood_Deeds_of_Fionn rel=noopener>The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn</a></em>. The main character,¬†
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill rel=noopener>Fionn mac Cumhaill</a>, is raised in isolation and undergoes many adventures akin to those of Perceval, suggesting that the narrative may have been a source of inspiration for Chr√©tien.</p></blockquote><p>without getting too in the weeds here because this is all a story for another day, i have a suspicion that <a class="internal-link broken">fontaine</a> is going to incorporate a lot of stuff from irish mythology. especially that last character, fionn.</p><p>for now, just know that irish mythology is divided into four cycles: the mythological cycle, the ulster cycle, the fianna cycle, and the kings‚Äô cycle. the ulster cycle in particular is mostly about a hero named cu chulainn, who manymanymany people have speculated was a source of inspiration for <a href=/notes/characters/playable/childe rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/characters/playable/childe>childe</a>.</p><p>cu chulainn was trained by a warrior woman named scathach (possibly <a class="internal-link broken">skirk</a>!) who gave him his spear, gae bulg‚Äîthe description of the spear is honestly not too far off from childe&rsquo;s hydro weapons‚Äîand he basically becomes this insane hero at a young age who turns into ‚Äúan unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe‚Äù when fights.
