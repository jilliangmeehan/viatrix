Eberhart would eventually turn on him, forcing him to flee to Liyue in disgrace. He joined the Skipper&rsquo;s crew and eventually met his end in battle against the sea monster that the Skipper sought to take revenge on.</p></blockquote><p>the <a class="internal-link broken">heart of depth</a> artifact set tells the story of his travels with the skipper.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">the exile</a> set might also be about parsifal but it gets a little muddy. first, it’s unclear if parsifal was exiled from mondstadt or if just chose to leave. second, the exile’s goblet was a family heirloom of the exile & it says he carved out the gem himself, whereas all the other parsifal lore says <em>he</em> carved out the sapphire of a goblet he stole from some noble house. who knows! could be another exiled aristocrat, but a lot of the details do seem to match up.</p><a href=#blue-eyed-spear-witch><h2 id=blue-eyed-spear-witch><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>blue-eyed spear witch</h2></a><p>sometime while parsifal was in mondstadt, he met the <strong><a class="internal-link broken">blue-eyed spear witch</a></strong>—who was a servant for an aristocratic family at the time.</p><blockquote><p>he was leaving a mansion with stolen goods and noticed a woman in a window whose eyes were as blue as the gem in the silver cup he had just stolen. Struck by her beauty, he climbed up to her, pried the blue gem out of the silver cup and gave it to her as a gift.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this blue gem had the crest of the ruling family on it, and when the woman&rsquo;s master found out she had it, she was punished, which caused her to become angry at Parsifal despite still being in love with him. The next time they met she warned that someday she would pay him back for the scars inflicted on her due to his actions, and they seemingly never met again.</p></blockquote><p>at some point before leaving mondstadt, parsifal stopped at the shop in <a class="internal-link broken">heart’s desire (sapphire)</a> to buy “the special <a class="internal-link broken">wine</a> that helps you forget about the one you long for” but it has already been purchased by the blue-eyed spear witch, who exchanged the sapphire he gave her for the wine.</p><p>the <a class="internal-link broken">wine and song</a> catalyst description tells the story of them meeting but gives them a happy ending where they went to explore the world together—“For no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.”</p><p>supposedly, eberhart was trained by the blue-eyed spear witch after parsifal left mondstadt & later killed her—i don’t think it explicitly says anywhere that she died, but it’s heavily implied in the <a class="internal-link broken">crescent pike</a> weapon description</p><p>one other thing that i’m still not sure about that swirls around in my head a lot is the <a class="internal-link broken">hex and hound</a> book, which is about two shapeshifting sisters, one of which has blue eyes. i think it’s possible this is the blue-eyed spear witch, and if <em>that’s</em> true i think it’s possible she survived.</p><a href=#eberhart><h2 id=eberhart><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>eberhart</h2></a><p>eberhart was the half-brother of parsifal & ingbert — he resented his noble lineage & wanted to “recapture the glory and pride of ancient nobility” and “destroy these rotten foundations.”<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>he was the owner of the unnamed gladiator that was killed by <a class="internal-link broken">vennessa</a> from the <a class="internal-link broken">gladiator</a> artifact set (to give you a sense of the timeline).</p><p>he went on an expedition to <a class="internal-link broken">dragonspine</a> with ingbert & and a few other aristocrats—on this expedition, he laid traps & killed the others. he was supposedly gravely wounded, and we’re not sure if he lived / made it back to mondstadt.</p><p>later, he became the <a class="internal-link broken">blue-eyed spear witch</a>’s disciple (knowing she was in love with parsifal) “to learn the fatal loophole in her art, all the better to slay her with…” & killed her<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><blockquote><p>So what if those who came after should despise me?

(<a href=/notes/sun rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/sun>sun</a> god!)</p><blockquote class=note-callout><p>the knight of the swan story also ties into melusines, which we&rsquo;ll apparently be seeing in fontaine. the whole never-ask-my-name thing & related variations has come up a lot in genshin — hopefully i will remember to compile some notes on it at some point.</p></blockquote><p>lohengrin’s twin brother inherits their father parzival’s land while lohengrin is sent out as a grail knight “in secret” to help kingdoms that have lost their protectors. he shows up in a kingdom without a male heir & offers marry the duchess there & defend the kingdom, on the condition that she must never ask his name. all is good for a few years, but then she asks the question & he gets right back on his swan boat and never returns.</p><p>in the opera, the reason lohengrin shows up & has to defend the duchess is because she’s being wrongfully accused of murdering her brother—in the end, it turns out the swan from the swan boat is her brother, who was cursed by a witch lol.</p><a href=#irish-myth-stuff><h2 id=irish-myth-stuff><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>irish myth stuff</h2></a><p>via wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p>There are possible parallels in <em>Perceval</em> with the Irish mythological race of the 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann rel=noopener>Tuatha Dé Danann</a>. The race has three central talismans, a spear, a cauldron, and a sword, that correlate with the spear, grail, and sword present in <em>Perceval</em>.[^ ]Chrétien&rsquo;s <em>Perceval</em> also includes many similarities to the Irish saga <em>
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boyhood_Deeds_of_Fionn rel=noopener>The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn</a></em>. The main character, 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill rel=noopener>Fionn mac Cumhaill</a>, is raised in isolation and undergoes many adventures akin to those of Perceval, suggesting that the narrative may have been a source of inspiration for Chrétien.</p></blockquote><p>without getting too in the weeds here because this is all a story for another day, i have a suspicion that <a class="internal-link broken">fontaine</a> is going to incorporate a lot of stuff from irish mythology. especially that last character, fionn.</p><p>for now, just know that irish mythology is divided into four cycles: the mythological cycle, the ulster cycle, the fianna cycle, and the kings’ cycle. the ulster cycle in particular is mostly about a hero named cu chulainn, who manymanymany people have speculated was a source of inspiration for <a href=/notes/characters/playable/childe rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/characters/playable/childe>childe</a>.</p><p>cu chulainn was trained by a warrior woman named scathach (possibly <a class="internal-link broken">skirk</a>!) who gave him his spear, gae bulg—the description of the spear is honestly not too far off from childe&rsquo;s hydro weapons—and he basically becomes this insane hero at a young age who turns into “an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe” when fights. (like literally, that is not a metaphor, he becomes a monster. very foul legacy of him.)</p><a href=#childe><h2 id=childe><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>childe</h2></a><p>this is farfetched, but i basically have a theory that <a href=/notes/characters/playable/childe rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/characters/playable/childe>childe</a> is somehow a distant descendant of parsifal and the blue-eyed spear witch—the resemblance of the heart of depth guy, the fact that he uses the <a class="internal-link broken">freedom talent books</a> from mondstadt, the dead blue eyes.</p><p>let it be known that i had this theory first but ashikai has
