<a href=https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Wanderer%27s_Troupe_%28Faction%29 rel=noopener>wiki</a> claims that the sojourner was killed in the uprising, but that doesn&rsquo;t seem true to me since this mentions that he &ldquo;grew accustomed to life in this foreign land&rdquo; <em>after</em> the mention of the uprising. (that said, i&rsquo;ve noticed that artifact lore is not always linear & &ldquo;losing a place to call home&rdquo; is a little at odds with &ldquo;growing accustomed to life in this foreign land.&rdquo;)</p><p>it&rsquo;s also unclear what the fate of the woman was — she could have been killed in the uprising, but this only mentions that they &ldquo;stole his love&rsquo;s joy&rdquo; and &ldquo;had taken her smile,&rdquo; so it&rsquo;s possible she lived, albeit unhappily.</p><p><em>also</em>: who was his &ldquo;best friend&rdquo;? what is the significance of his &ldquo;final arrow&rdquo;? lots that i&rsquo;m still curious about.</p><a href=#notesartifactssands-of-eonsundial-of-the-sojourner><h2 id=notesartifactssands-of-eonsundial-of-the-sojourner><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a href=/notes/artifacts/sands-of-eon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/artifacts/sands-of-eon>sundial of the sojourner</a></h2></a><p><em>&ldquo;A sundial that has survived the ages, always silently recording the cycles of the <a href=/notes/sun rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/sun>sun</a> and <a href=/notes/moon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/moon>moon</a> as they pass through the sky.&rdquo;</em></p><blockquote><p>The traveler pursued both <a class="internal-link broken">fate</a> and the inexorable passage of <a class="internal-link broken">time</a>.</p><p>The troupe that resisted the aristocracy — and their end — could be seen in the eternal flow of time.</p><p>In the course of a long journey, even the most well-made watch might cease to work.<br>The only unfailing marker of time was the passage of the <a href=/notes/sun rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/sun>sun</a> and <a href=/notes/moon rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/notes/moon>moon</a>.<br>So to chase formless time, the traveler could only pursue <a class="internal-link broken">light</a> itself.</p><p>The great halls of the nobility, and the rebellious troupe with no room to lay their heads.<br>Both were churned just the same by the flow of time, and both like fleeting <a class="internal-link broken">dreams</a> raced towards the same destruction.</p><p>Under the moonless night sky, the dark shadows drew upon the outlander&rsquo;s tired face.<br>&ldquo;The songs are spent like arrows few, to the choir the curtain calls.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Shall I ever see you smile anew, when the tower in the city square falls?&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>again, i think the mention of &ldquo;their end&rdquo; here isn&rsquo;t necessarily referring to the deaths of the <a class="internal-link broken">wanderers’ troupe</a>, just the fact that they disbanded after the failed uprising.</p><p>&ldquo;when the tower in the city square falls&rdquo; is probably refering to the tower the <a class="internal-link broken">lawrence clan</a> built in the plaza, which is where the chosen woman (&ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;) would throw the <a class="internal-link broken">ludi harpastum</a> ball from.
