Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.796971343Z","tags":null},"/.trash/instructions/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](private/instructions/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](private/instructions/hosting.md) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](private/instructions/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](private/instructions/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](private/instructions/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](private/instructions/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](private/instructions/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](private/instructions/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](private/instructions/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.796971343Z","tags":null},"/.trash/instructions/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

Scholar Jacob Musk will show you the mysterious spiritual world of the hilichurls through this poetry collection!\n\nA collection of hilichurl poetry compiled by the Mondstadt ecologist Jacob Musk. During the writing of this book, Musk traveled across the continent to visit every hilichurl tribe, even going so far as to venture deep into hilichurl settlements and become intimately acquainted with their lives. Musk was praised as the \"Poet Laureate of Hilichurlian\" for this book, but it is evident that neither the scholar himself nor the hilichurls were particularly fond of this honor. Jacob Musk, though enthusiastic about hilichurl studies, loathed to be associated with them even in his late years.  \n  \nThe first song:  \nMi muhe ye  \nMi biat ye  \nBiat ye dada  \nMuhe dada  \n  \nQuite possibly a battle song sung by the hilichurls before combat. I have observed that when two or more hilichurls are present, they engage in frenzied brawling after singing this vulgar song.  \n  \nThe second poem:  \nEleka mimi-a-Domu  \nMita domu-a-dada  \nLa-la-la  \nLa-la-la  \nMimi mosi ye mita  \n  \nThe song is sung by hilichurls as they dance around totem poles. In my estimation it is some form of tribal hymn. It has an upbeat tone and is usually heard during festivals.  \n  \nThe third poem:  \nMi muhe mita nye  \nMi muhe mita nye  \nMuhe nye  \nMuhe nye  \nGusha  \nBiat, gusha  \n  \nA melancholic hilichurl song I heard during an exchange with an elderly samachurl. Although I do not yet understand the literal meaning of the poem, the overwhelming sense of grief that comes through in the song is enough to captivate the best poets in my birthplace (despite such praise, I must admit the acrid smells coming from the elderly hilichurls were just as melancholic, and just as overwhelming).\n## volume ii\n\u003e Are wine and poetry a part of the hilichurl lifestyle? Do they have pure and devout desires? Expert on the hilichurls, Jacob Musk, is here to answer!\n\nThe fourth poem:  \nCeli upa celi  \nSada shato lata  \nKuzi unu ya zido  \nUnu dada  \n  \nA song sung by samachurls. Judging by the reaction of the chief, the song seems to bear a special philosophical meaning for the hilichurls. It may appear ridiculous in mainstream academic circles, and I have no intention of casting doubt upon well-established views, but I feel obliged to say that the question of whether philosophical discourse truly exists among the hilichurls is one that still fascinates me to this day, and may be deserving of further study.  \n  \nThe fifth song:  \nNini movo muhe yoyo  \nNini movo mimi tomo  \nLata movo mosi yoyo  \nCeli movo celi yoyo  \n  \nMuch like the people of Mondstadt, the wind-worshiping hilichurl tribes often drink to excess and sing endless songs of praise to the Anemo Archon. This is a hilichurl ode that is often heard when they are inebriated.  \n  \nThe sixth song:  \nUnu, unu  \nYaya ika kundala!  \nUnu, unu  \nMita dada ya dala?  \nUnu, unu  \nKuzi mita dada ye  \nMita dada-a-mimi  \n  \nA pious ode that is only sung by hilichurls during sacrifices. When performing this ode, the hilichurls often add percussion by beating the backsides of the weakest tribe members with planks, creating rhythmic ringing sounds. It must be quite painful.  \n  \nThe seventh song:  \nMimi movo  \nMimi sada  \nMimi domu  \nDomu upa  \nGusha dada  \n  \nIt appears that many hilichurl tribes share a tradition of exchanging songs around bonfires in the moonlight. This song is one such bonfire ballad sung by the chief at the end of the night. At the end of the song, the chief shouts \"nunu\" three times, which presumably carries the meaning of \"sleep.\"","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.796971343Z","tags":null},"/notes/books/the-boar-princess":{"title":"the boar princess","content":"## volume i\n\u003e A long, long time ago, in the forest kingdom... What legends occurred there? \n\u003e \n\u003e A story about friendship, love, and death.\n\nIn the myths of ages past, every living being in this world had its own kingdom.  \nMondstadt was a forest in that age, a playground of the boars.  \n\nIn the forest was the Boar Kingdom, where everybody lived happily under the reign of the Boar King.  \n\nThe King had a lovely young daughter, who had the prettiest snout, the whitest tusks, and the smoothest fur in the whole kingdom.  \n\nThe Boar Princess, beautiful and kind, gave the juiciest and sweetest fruits to her subjects every day.  \n\nFrom sweet and sour berries, to crisp apples, to delicious tree mushrooms, the Boar Princess always shared her delicacies first with her friends.  \n\nEvery boar in the kingdom adored their King and Princess, and every day they praised them so:  \n\n\"Oink, oink! Bless our King! As long as he reigns over us, we will never starve!\"  \n\n\"Oink, oink! Bless the gentle Anemo Archon for giving our King such a kind and polite Princess!\"  \n\n---\n  \n(There are some words in the margin written in tiny handwriting: \"dada, if I dont eat candy efery night, and i pray eferyday, will i turn into a wild piggy? i want to be a wild piggy because they are so tasty\")\n## volume ii\n\u003e A lifeless ice field, a land even the gentle Anemo Archon has never visited. How is it that it still has its lonely inhabitants? \n\nNorth of the boar forest was a frozen tundra.  \n\nThe playful Barbatos had not reached those lands, so they remained covered by ice and snow.  \n\nEvery creature who ventured there risked freezing their paws and hooves off.  \n\n\"It's cold, too cold! It's freezing! My claws are going to shatter!\"  \n\nEven the bravest, strongest Boar King could not withstand the frigid tundra.  \n\n\"Oink, oink, oink! My frozen snout is turning purple!\"  \n\nThere lived but a single lone wolf pup in that place.  \n\n---\n  \n(The childish handwriting at the bottom of the page reads: \"dada, why does the little doggy have paws that don't freeze off in the cold?\")\n## volume iii\n\u003e \"Now and evermore shall you be bereft of hope.\" What fate awaits the wolf pup who bears such a cruel curse? \n\nThe pup was a carefree child who had bright blue eyes and slick gray fur.  \n\nWhen he got angry, he looked exactly like the wolf head relief atop the Mondstadt Cathedral.  \n\nBut one day, when he was hunting in the forest, he ran into the evil squirrel sorcerer: Woobakwa!  \n\nOf all the beings in the ancient world, none were more evil than Woobakwa ‚Äî not even demons and dragons. Woobaka despised everything nice, and swore to transform beauty into ugliness and turn light into dark.  \n\nAt the sight of the joyful wolf, anger boiled inside him. He cursed:  \n\n\"Squeak! Squeak! Angry am I! I shall spike his heart with the coldest ice, and he will never again know the meaning of hope!\"  \n\nWith that said, Woobakwa began to curse the pup with his magic.  \n\nBut the rash pup gobbled him up, just like that, without the slightest warning.  \n\nWoobakwa was so furious that he cursed the pup using the most foul and insulting words ever uttered by a squirrel. The pup felt the noise coming from his mouth, and only then did he realize his mistake.  \n\n\"Aroo, I'm so sorry, mister squirrel, I thought you were edible!\"  \n\nThe pup wished to apologize to the squirrel, but he felt his throat tighten and then loosen. The squirrel slid down to his stomach with a gulp.  \n\n---\n  \n(A sheet of paper bearing fine handwriting is taped to this page: \"Lily, this is why you should eat cautiously when you're outside.\")\n## volume iv\n\u003e The wolf pup grew up in the cold loneliness. The secret past of the lone wolf is now revealed. \n\nNo one knew just what chemical reaction occurred in the pup's stomach, but Woobakwa's curse magically came into effect!  \n\nBecause of the curse, the pup's heart was pierced and frozen by an icicle. The pup became cold and mean forever after, and whenever other animals showed kindness to him, he would repay them with the harshest of words or the most woeful of deeds. In the end, every animal loathed him.  \n\nFrom then on, every wolf in the forest spoke of the pup in this way:  \n\n\"Woof, what a selfish wolf he is! Such an obnoxious kid.\"  \n\n\"Woof, woof, what a heartless wolf he is! Let us stay away from him.\"  \n\nOne by one, the pup lost all his friends. The forest welcomed the lonely pup no more, so he had no choice but to head north.  \n\nThe blizzards that blew in the northern tundra kept most creatures away. But with his heart already frozen solid, the pup was no longer afraid of the cold.  \n\nHe decided to settle down there, and became the lone wolf that roamed the tundra.  \n\n---\n  \n(A young girl has written in the corner of the page: \"Dada, but where did Woobakwa go?\")\n## volume v\n\u003e \"No one deserves this fate.\" The good princess sheds a tear of compassion. For those who persevere as true companions, even the ice shall melt before their determination.  \n\nOne day, the Boar Princess heard about the pup and was deeply saddened by his story.  \n\nSo she asked her people for advice on how to defrost his heart and turn him back to his former sweet self.  \n\nShe asked and asked, but only the wise fox and the elderly turtle knew the answer:  \n\"Ack-ack-ack! Only sincerity and fire could melt such evil ice. Ack-ack-ack!\" The fox replied.  \n\n\"Friendship demands sacrifice. No friendships come without sacrifices. I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds,\" the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle said. \n\nThe clever Boar Princess knew right away what she had to do. She dried her tears and curtsied to the two wise animals:  \n\n\"Oink oink! Thank you! I would like for you to come and see the pup with me, so that you can be the first to witness our friendship!\"  \n\nWhen the fox and the turtle heard the Boar Princess was willing to invite them on a royal trip, their hearts were filled with joy. They set out with the Princess and headed north.  \n\n---\n  \n(A handwritten note, seemingly from the young girl's father, is taped to the page: \"Turtles can't make noises, no matter how hard they try. The reason Grandpa Turtle apologizes for this is just because he is very polite.\")\n## volume vi\n\u003e The Boar Princess and her two wise companions brave an icy wasteland and scale a snowy mountain, where they discover a very mysterious inhabitant indeed...\n\u003e \n\u003e See how this high-altitude, low-temperature adventure unfolds in volume six of The Boar Princess. \n\u003e \n\u003e There is some childish handwriting on the title page, which reads: \"Daddy, when you get home, you have to read me the one about the snowy mountain too!\"\n\nAnd so, the Princess and her two wise companions arrived in the snowswept hinterland of the far north.  \n\nIce and snow covered the land as far as the eye could see. Neither the biggest, bravest animals nor even the weasel, who is the most skilled digger of them all, could find so much as a single blade of soft grass or a single piece of juicy fruit. \n\nThe Princess was shivering from head to tail in the freezing cold, yet she was undaunted. Without even looking back, she pressed on deeper into the frozen wasteland.  \n\nThe wise fox and the trustworthy turtle could not bear the piercing wind and the freezing snow. They begged of the Princess:  \n\n\"Ack-ack-ack! If His Majesty the King knew that you were adventuring to such a cold and dangerous place as this, he would be very worried! Let's head back home... Ack-ack-ack,\" exclaimed the fox.  \n\n\"Yes, I agree! I fear the snowstorm will get stronger and colder with each passing second... Let us at least rest a while, and continue our journey once the wind has stopped and the sun is out? Once again, I apologize for not knowing how to make funny sounds,\" reasoned the turtle.  \n\nIt was to no avail. The persevering Princess did not heed the advice of her wise companions, but insisted that they continue to press on into the bitter cold of the far north.  \n\nFor what nobler cause could one pursue in this world than rescuing lost kin and rekindling lost friendships?  \n\nOnwards they continued through the ice and snow, until their paws and hooves were purple from the cold, until each breath they exhaled turned into ice which became one with the swirling blizzard around them.  \n\nThen, at the icy peak of a tall mountain, next to a frozen river which, in spite of everything, still flowed ‚Äî albeit with icicles rather than water ‚Äî the Princess met a spirit, swaying to and fro in the freezing wind.  \n\nAn ancient race of wise spirits lived atop that ice-capped mountain. They had no physical form, but possessed great magical power.  \n\n\"Oink oink! Are you the master of this place? Please, O Spirit, could you guide us through this snowstorm?\"  \n\nThe Princess politely posed her question as her hooves, now numb from the cold, trembled in the snow. \n\nThe wise fox and the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle also looked expectantly at the spirit of the snowstorm. As they gazed, their paws and flippers, respectively, numb from the cold, trembled in the snow.  \n\n\"Whoosh, whoosh...\"  \n\nThe spirit of the snowstorm spoke softly.  \n\n\"Of course, but... whoosh, whoosh...\"  \n\n\"In return, I will sap your energy. The further forward you go in the storm, the more tired and hungry you will become ‚Äî though I assure you, it will not be life threatening... I hope... Whoosh, whoosh...\"  \n\n\"Oink oink! This is, after all, the spirit of the snowstorm,\" pondered the Princess. \n\n\"And I am also in the company of the two wisest, most caring members of my family. Whatever may happen, they will always be able to find a way!\"  \n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Princess granted the spirit of the snowstorm her request. The wise fox and the trustworthy Grandpa Turtle had no time at all to formulate, let alone articulate, any remonstration.  \n\n\"Oink oink, I do declare this deal a fair one! Now, lead us to the wolf pup!\"  \n\nAnd so, the spirit turned into an ice stream, and carried the persevering Princess over the tall mountain...\n## volume vii\n\u003e All the sacrifices made out in the frozen plains were not in vain. The perfect ending of friendship, love, life and death! \n\u003e \n\u003e This is the end to the famous and touching story, The Boar Princess.\n\nAfter venturing though the bitter cold and the swirling storms, the Boar Princess finally saw the pup.  \n\nCovered in ice, the poor pup's once bright blue eyes had now grown dim, and he had all but forgotten how to bark.  \n\n\"Aroo! You have come at the right moment, for I haven't had lunch yet!\"  \n\nHearing his words, the kind Boar Princess could not help but shed tears. Her warm tears seemed to melt a little of the ice at the tip of the pup's heart.  \n\n\"Aroo! Why are you crying?\"\n\n\"Oink, oink! You are going to starve out here ‚Äî I have never seen such misery in my kingdom!\"  \n\n\"I will sacrifice everything to feed your hungry belly!\"  \n\nThe pup was stupefied by her words.  \n\n\"Arooooooo! Miss, you must be mad! No one has ever dared say such a thing to me!\"  \n\nBut when the pup saw the determination in her eyes, his frozen heart melted some more.  \n\n\"Nope! That's why...\"  \n\n\"I will sacrifice two of the wisest and most caring members of my family just to feed you! It is for the sake of our friendship!\"  \n\nThe fox knew what horror she meant and attempted to run, but he was pinned to the ground by the pup and the Boar Princess. Grandpa Turtle was so frightened by the sight that he retreated into his shell.  \n\nThe pup and the Boar Princess enjoyed a delicious appetizer of fox out in the snow. \n\nNext, they found a cave, picked a few mushrooms, built a fire with some moss, and treated themselves to a tasty turtle soup.  \n\nThe pup felt the delight of sharing and making friends for the first time he could remember. His frozen heart melted completely, and he shed tears of joy.  \n\nThe Princess took the pup by his paw, and the two merrily returned to their home. \n\n---\n  \n(Wedged between the last two pages is a card bearing elegant handwriting: \"Honey, I think it would be best if we donated this one to the library...\")","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.796971343Z","tags":null},"/notes/books/the-fox-in-the-dandelion-sea":{"title":"the fox in the dandelion sea","content":"## volume i\n\u003e \"Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land,\" the Fox chants.

The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago.  \n\nI couldn't remember much about her, but felt that her eyes must have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstone within.  \n\nI became lost in thought as I stared at the glistening water. Walking transfixed along the lakeside, I had forgotten entirely that I was out for a hunt.  \n\nI came to when I heard the sound of something freezing up. It was a Mist Flower growing by the lake, having just frozen the water around it. Next to it was a white fox, its tail frozen in the ice. Poor critter.  \n\n\"It must have had its tail in the water by the Mist Flower while it was drinking.\" \n\nMist Flowers are dangerous plants and can cause frostbite if handled without care. Extreme caution must be taken when handling them.  \n\nAs it saw me approach, the fox struggled in fear, but its still-frozen tail kept it rooted to the spot. The fox whimpered in pain.  \n\n\"Oh no, this won't do.\"  \n\nI thought to myself. \n\n\"Poor critter. It's gonna die anyway if I don't save it, may as well end its pain by bringing it home as my game for the day.\"  \n\nI imagined what a delicious fox stew I could cook with the carrots I grew. Just thinking about it gave me energy and brought a smile to my face. \n\nSo I took out my hunting bow and slowly walked toward it.  \n\n\"Be good and stay put.\"\n## volume ii\n\u003e \"Be good and stay put.\" Trapped by a Mist Flower, what does fate have in store by the fox who met a hunter? \n\n\"Be good and stay put.\"  \n\nThat's what my father's father had taught me. When I went fox hunting, I always chanted his words silently, so that my hands wouldn't shake when pulling the bowstring.  \n\nBut just as I was about to release the arrow, the fox lifted its head and looked me straight in the eye. It had eyes like the lake, glistening as if harboring fragments of gemstone within.  \n\nMy head began spinning, as if a strong wind were blowing inside it. My arrow missed its target and instead smashed the ice, releasing the fox's tail. The fox raised its tail and looked at me once more before running off into the forest. \n\nI came to my senses and began the chase ‚Äî but who in this world can run faster than a fox?  \n\nGradually, the fox began to shrink into the distance, eventually turning into a white spot.  \n\n\"Hey! Don't go!\"  \n\nI shouted, barely catching my breath.  \n\nAfter hearing my words, the spot seemed to slow.  \n\n\"Is it waiting for me?\"  \n\nI pondered.  \n\n\"If running for its life, a fox is able to shake off anyone in no time.\"  \n\nFoxes are strange animals. Even when running on a flat plain like at Windrise, where one can see clearly for miles ahead, they somehow still seem to disappear from view.  \n\nIt's almost as if they run into another world.  \n\nThis led me to my conclusion:  \n\n\"The fox must be waiting for me!\"  \n\nConvinced of this fact, I chased the glittering white spot for hours on end. \nSuddenly, a chilling wind began to blow.  \n\nI stood there, shivering, and what I saw next astounded me.  \n\n\"How can this be?\"  \n\nSuddenly, instead of one, there were now two white spots.  \n\nMore appeared. Three, four, five... They seemed to grow in number as the winds blew. Eventually I lost track.  \n\nSuddenly, with a stinging sensation, one of them flew directly into my eye. Upon inspection, I discovered that the spots were in fact nothing more than dandelion seeds floating in the wind. The fox had disappeared.  \n\nI laughed at my own foolishness and went home.  \n\nFor supper, I had carrot fox stew ‚Äî though without fox, or any other meat for that matter. The gods know how much I hate boiled carrots without meat! I felt starving, and in time fell asleep.  \n\nI awoke in the middle of the night to something stirring outside my door.\n## volume iii\n\u003e The Hunter of fruitless hunts was awoken by a commotion outside. Who is at his door? The story of the Hunter and the Fox continues.\n\nHaving failed to catch the fox, I went to sleep with only tasteless boiled carrots in my stomach. If not for what happened next, I would have forgotten about the fox by now.  \n\nI awoke with a start to strange noises coming from outside my door.  \n\n\"Perhaps boars have come to eat my carrots?\"  \n\nI hopped out of bed and opened my door. To my surprise, there stood a tiny little white fox. Its fur was so white that it glowed in the dark, not unlike the way sunlight sparkles on water after filtering through the treetops.  \n\n\"This must be the same fox from earlier!\" \n\nI thought again of those eyes that looked like gemstones in the water, gazing at me as if from the depths of my heart.  \n\nAnd so I walked over to the fox, unarmed and with tired eyes.  \n\nThis time it stayed still and waited for me in silence.  \n\nThe closer I drew, the greater in stature it became. \n\nBy the time I stood before it, it had magically transformed into a human. \n\nShe was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water ‚Äî in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops.  \n\n\"What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.\"  \n\nI thought to myself.  \n\n\"This can't be. Must be some type of fox magic.\"  \n\nStranger still, the idea of \"fox magic\" had only occurred to me in that instant. You'd believe anything after you'd seen those eyes.  \n\nFor all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the dead of night.  \n\nAnd at last she spoke. Though not in our common tongue, I could somehow understand her. Some other magic, perhaps.  \n\n\"I would have died by that lake, if you had not come in my hour of need.\"  \n\nShe paused and continued:  \n\n\"Although to die by that gemstone lake is no bad thing,\"  \n\n\"We foxes are grateful beings, so you must let me return the favor.\"  \n\nShe bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams.\n## volume iv\n\u003e After a few days apart, a long-awaited reunion takes place on a midsummer's night amidst a veritable blizzard of dandelion seeds. At the direction of the fox, an ocean of dandelions opens up before the hunter's very eyes...\n\nFor the next few days after that night, the fox never came again.  \n\nBut in those few days, prey in the forest became gradually more abundant. \n\nEverything from small finches, long-legged cranes, and even scurrying boars... \n\nMaybe it was the change in season, or some sort of repayment from the fox. \n\nWhatever the case, the following days brought real stew to the table.  \n\nBut the fox never came again.  \n\nAs strange as it may seem, it had honestly been easier to sleep hungry. Even with a full, satisfied stomach, I couldn't help but think about the day we met, and the woman that the fox had turned into...  \n\nWhen would I gaze upon her eyes again, glittering... like water in a lake.  \n\nLying half-asleep with a heart full of turmoil, I heard a faint sound outside my door. \n\n---\n\nI hopped from the bed and swung the door open, eager to see a small white silhouette awaiting me.  \n\nBut there were no lake-blue eyes, and there was no fluffy white foxtail. Instead, all I could see were dandelion seeds drifting in the white moonlight, floating like snowflakes in the air.  \n\nSuddenly, something got caught in my nostrils.  \n\n\"Ah-Ahchooo!!!\"  \n\nImmediately, the fluffy white dandelion seeds began to swirl, filling the sky like a snowstorm.  \n\nAmidst the flurry of dandelion seeds, a pair of jewel-like eyes were looking at me, staring straight into my heart.  \n\nWaving away the swirling dandelion seeds, I started walking towards the small fox.  \n\nThe fox raised its ears and its furry tail flitted across the grass as it turned and disappeared into the depths of the forest.  \n\nI hurried and followed closely behind.  \n\nIn amongst the darkness of the trees, soft patches of white could be seen weaving between the shadows.  \n\nTheir silhouettes tip-toed like moonlight cast among the tree leaves, or like the hesitant strides of a crafty Seelie.  \n\nWith unfaltering trust, I followed the fox round and about, soon emerging from the dark forest in a seemingly faraway land.  \n\nThere, in the moonlight, a sea of dandelions lay before me, stretching as far as my eyes could see.  \n\nStunned by the sight, I began to notice a rustling noise coming from just behind me. \n\n---\n\nIt was a light, delicate sound. Like that of a girl walking barefoot across pine needles and leaves on the ground.  \n\nThe fox approached me from behind. The night air ferried her presence, cool and damp, whisked together with the slightly bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers.  \nTwo hands with slender, ice-cold fingers rested upon my shoulders.  \n\nShe leaned in close to my ear and her long hair draped down over my shoulder.  \nBehind me, I felt the soft rhythm of both her breath and her heartbeat. It made me feel calm and at ease.  \n\n\"Only the foxes know the way to this place. It is the homeland of the dandelions.  \n\nIt is my desire that you would tarry here, and teach my child human language...  \nIn return, I will teach you the magic of foxes.\"  \n\nThere was a tickle in my ear, as if one of the dandelion seeds had grazed it on its journey into the warm night air.  \n\nStrange. I had certainly never mentioned anything about magic to her before. How could she have known?  \n\nWithout answering, she took my hand and led me into the depths of the sea of dandelions.  \n\nThe night breezes from both north and south carried the bitter fragrance of dandelion flowers and faded memories...  \n\nIn those fields of velvet white, she showed me how foxes play gently together in their own fashion, until the [[notes/reference/motifs/moon|moon]] rose high into the starry sky.\n## volume v\n\u003e Upon accepting the Fox's conditions, he came to the place where all the prey who disappeared had eventually gone to ‚Äî an endless field of dandelions. The story of the Hunter and the Fox in the sea of dandelions. \n\nIn a boundless sea of dandelions that existed in the middle of nowhere, I watched as the seeds took off at the softest touch of the breeze. Suddenly, I knew the answer to that question that had been lingering on my mind for years.  \n\n\"So all the foxes that disappear during the hunt, this is where they hide away.\"  \n\nI thought to myself.  \n\n\"What a beautiful place.\"  \n\nBut when I began teaching the little fox to speak our common tongue, my heart always felt empty, like a wind was blowing inside of me.  \n\nWhen we talked, I would look into her gemstone-lake eyes. In those moments I felt like I was speaking not to the fox, but to a girl I used to love many years ago.  \n\nAnd so, when she was around me, it was as if I were in the presence of the child of someone I had once loved: We had an enjoyable time together, but the experience was somehow tinged with sadness.  \n\nBut the thought of her promise ‚Äî if I succeeded in teaching her child to speak the common tongue...  \n\n\"I shall impart the magic of transformation to you when the time comes.\"  \n\nRemembering the way she made that solemn promise to me... I knew she was serious, and that gave me determination.  \n\nCould I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef.  \n\n\"I could even use magic to hunt!\" I couldn't contain my excitement. \"No more meatless carrot stews for me...\"  \n\nI lost track of how long I stayed in the dandelion sea, where everything sways gently with the wind.  \n\nOne reason was that the little one was such a fast learner! I taught him not only our language, but everything I knew in one package, including how to count, how to grow carrots, how to change window panes, and how to sharpen knives.  \n\nWhen it came to rest, we would talk idly.  \n\n\"Why must you learn human speech?\"  \n\nHe answered swiftly:  \n\n\"So that when I transform into a human, I can befriend them!\"  \n\nI continued:  \n\n\"Why would you want to befriend the humans?\"  \n\nHe dropped his gaze.\n## volume vi\n\u003e \"Why do you want to learn the language of human?\" \"So I can befriend humans when I become one.\" The child-like voice says, in the sea of dandelions. \n\n\"Why must you learn human speech?\"  \n\nOn one occasion, I asked the little fox this question.  \n\nHe answered cheerfully in the common tongue:  \n\n\"So that when I transform into a human, I can befriend them!\"  \n\n\"Why would you want to befriend the humans?\"  \n\nThis seemed to make him sad, and he dropped his gaze.  \n\n\"I saw a boy in the distant forest.\"  \n\n\"He was dressed in gray. He looked and had eyes like a wolf,\" he added.  \n\n\"I had just mastered my magic, and was running around excitedly on my hind legs. \n\nRunning on grass was fun! But sadly, due to the difference in height, a fox can't see or smell the same things that a human can.\"  \n\n\"I'm sure you can guess what happened next, teacher! Suddenly, I realized a horrible truth ‚Äî I was lost.\"  \n\nThere was pain in his voice as he relayed the events of that day.  \n\nIn the end, he had wandered into some faraway wood, and encountered vicious monsters.  \n\nJust when he thought he was done for, the gray lupine boy suddenly leapt out of the forest and chased away the monsters. Without a word, he then turned around and vanished into the woods.  \n\n\"If I could transform into a human and speak their language, I could track him down and make friends with him!\"  \n\nHe said gleefully.  \n\nI couldn't help but ask when I heard his reply:  \n\n\"Am I not your friend?\"  \n\nThe little one answered sincerely in the common tongue:  \n\n\"Mommy told me that it's different because you're my teacher ‚Äî but I'd only hurt you if I tell you that.\"  \n\nHe tilted his head in befuddlement. His fluffy tail patted the surrounding dandelions as he pondered over this difficult issue.  \n\n\"I know!\"  \n\nHe burst out.  \n\n\"If I know something that you don't, that would make me your teacher.\"  \n\n\"If we are both teachers, that would make us equals ‚Äî then we can be friends!\"  \nStill unfamiliar with the common tongue, he did his best to get the sentence out quickly.  \n\n\"Teacher, please allow me to teach you some magic that only I know.\"\n## volume vii\n\u003e \"Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land,\" the Fox chants. Can the Hunter also learn magic to make his wish come true? \n\n\"Teacher, please allow me to teach you some magic that only I know.\"  \n\nStill unfamiliar with the common tongue, he did his best to get the sentence out quickly, eager to befriend me.  \n\nHe picked a little dandelion.  \n\n\"Dandelion, dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land.\"  \n\nThe little fox chanted.  \n\nHe blew the dandelion flower and sent the seeds flying. He then spoke in a more serious tone.  \n\n\"May my teacher's wishes ride the wind and reach the Anemo Archon.\"  \n\nA wind blew past us and swept away the dandelion seeds.  \n\n\"See? The Anemo Archon has just answered my wish!\"  \n\nHe exclaimed merrily.  \n\n\"What wish did you make?\"  \n\n\"To become friends with my teacher.\"  \n\nHe lowered his head abruptly.  \n\n\"It must have been tiring to teach him to speak your language. Our mouths are structured differently from yours, so I must thank you for your effort.\"  \n\nWe had not noticed the mother fox approaching. Her eyes were like bottomless lakes, and the little fox quietly hid himself among the dandelions to escape her gaze.  \n\n\"When he has mastered human language,\"  \n\nI thought to myself.  \n\n\"When he has mastered human language,\"  \n\nShe spoke softly.\n## volume viii\n\u003e \"When he has mastered human language...\" The fox's voice is gently carried away by the midnight breeze, drifting further and further away together with the dandelion seeds... After all, the fox is a different kind of creature from the human, and the two do not share all the same sense of mirth and misery...\n\n\"When he has mastered human language...\"  \n\nThus she softly said.  \n\nI looked at her face, mesmerized.  \n\nI couldn't hear what she said after that. The mischievous night breeze was laden with dandelion seeds, which muffled her words.  \n\nOr perhaps that was her native language? The language of dandelions?  \n\nShe began to laugh as she perceived my clumsy, gauche appearance.  \n\nShe had the most beautiful laugh. The curved pupils in her eyes glistened like two crescent moons shining on ripples in the lake.  \n\n\"Now, tell me then, why is it you wish to learn fox magic?\"  \n\n\"I want to learn to transform just like foxes do. That way I could turn into a bird and fly to the highest of heights, and behold places that were once too far for my eyes to see.\"  \n\nThat was my reply.  \n\n\"Ahh yes, no longer will I need to lie in wait among the bushes while hunting. Instead, I will be able to freely soar high above like a falcon.\"  \n\nThus I kept thinking to myself.  \n\nAs I was thought to myself, the dandelion seed in my hand began to float up towards the moonlight, almost as if it had heard my thoughts.  \n\n\"I see...\"  \n\nShe lowered her head slightly and her long, black hair flowed down her neck like a waterfall, glistening in the moonlight. Her pale white skin shone brightly, seemingly reflecting the wisps of clouds in the night sky above.  \n\nI couldn't take my eyes off her. After a moment, I quickly turned my gaze away as I started blushing again.  \n\nFoxes are free animals. They would never cover their beauty because of shame like humans do.  \n\nAlthough this certainly wasn't the first time I beheld her, every time the moonlight shone upon her long hair, I couldn't help but blush and look away.  \n\nShe turned her face in thought for a moment, and let out a gentle sigh. She seemed rather displeased.  \n\nWe sat amidst the dandelion sea, not saying a word. A long time passed, long enough that I started thinking that she might be angry with me.  \n\n\"We foxes are grateful beings. I will teach you the magic of transformation, and so fulfill your wish.\"  \n\nThe fox said, turning her face towards me.  \n\nHer lake-blue eyes shone in the moonlight, and it made me feel at peace.  \n\nThank goodness, she wasn't mad at me.  \n\nFor some reason I could not clearly name, I quietly heaved a sight of relief.\n## volume ix\n\u003e When I have taught all that there is to teach, will it be possible to see this sea of dandelions again...? In the dandelion sea, the hunter starts to contemplate leaving.\n\nFoxes are clever animals. Clever and cunning.  \n\nThe little fox learned very quickly, and could sometimes even ask questions that would stump me.  \n\nFor human speech is complicated and intricate, nothing like the innocence of animal speech.  \n\nSometimes, language is like a yarn ball caught in the paws of a cat. It catches here and there, and there again it catches a student's tongue, sometimes even tripping a teacher up.  \n\nBut foxes are clever animals, and very quickly they learn the many intricacies of human speech that were handed down over the generations, becoming able to describe the way dandelions float away, or how the moonlight shines over the lake in a rudimentary manner.  \n\nEvery time the little fox discovered a new word, every time he tried using unfamiliar words to explore a familiar world, to bestow meanings upon the wind, dandelions and the earth, she would be beside him, smiling, watching us.  \n\nThe little fox learned very quickly, but I did not take much joy from that.  \n\nWhen I had run out of things to teach, would she still keep me here in this dandelion sea?  \n\nWhen that time came, would I still be able to behold those beautiful eyes under the moonlight?  \n\nWould she still lead me into the depths of the dandelion sea, smiling slyly as we frolicked and breathed in the bitter fragrance that came from both the north and south winds?  \n\nAs I thought about such things, I became lost in sullen [[notes/reference/motifs/memory|memory]].  \n\nYes, that's right. On that night that I could no longer remember clearly, when I was about to part with the girl I loved, this same [[notes/reference/motifs/moon|moon]] had hung in the sky as well.  \n\n\"Thank you for everything up till now.\"  \n\nBefore I knew it, the fox had walked in front of me. She bowed, and her hair spilled over her shoulders, flowing like water in the glimmering moonlight.  \n\n\"Once he has learned human speech, he should be able to make more new friends.\"  \n\n\"I am truly thankful to you for all you've done. He has also cheered up significantly since beginning to learn the human language.\"  \n\nShe gazed at me, her deep, unfathomable eyes shining like jewels.  \n\n\"Still, once you have finished teaching us the human language, where will you go then?\"  \n\nEnraptured by those shining eyes, I forgot to reply.  \n\nWas this fox magic, too? \n\nSeeing my wooden expression, the fox laughed and sighed.  \n\nThen, she turned and began walking in the direction of the [[notes/reference/motifs/moon|moon]], leading me further into the center of the moonlit dandelion sea.  \n\nSeeing this, the little fox swished its tail from side to side, and burrowed into the dandelion fields.\n## volume x\n\u003e The somber parting has finally arrived... The Fox bids farewell to its mother, teacher, and the dandelion sea. It's time to live up to the promise. The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, Part 10.\n\nThe little fox kept waving back to us as he walked. His figure grew smaller and smaller until it became a tiny white spot, which blended into the dandelion sea and slowly faded away.  \n\nAfter he had gone, the mother fox turned and walked over to me.  \n\nThe closer she drew, the greater in stature she became.  \n\nBy the time she stood before me, she had transformed into a human.  \n\nShe was a tall and slender woman, with a swan-like neck and pearly skin. Her eyes sparkled like gemstone fragments in pools of water ‚Äî in the darkness they seemed to shine like rays of sunlight on water after filtering through the treetops.  \n\n\"What a beauty. She looks a lot like the girl I fell in love with long ago, though I barely remember her name. Those eyes tell me she must be her.\"  \n\nI thought to myself.  \n\nFor all the magic and transformation I had witnessed, still nothing amazed me quite as much as the gemstone lakes of her eyes. For a while, we stood silently in the boundless dandelion sea.  \n\nAt last, I could no longer contain myself, and opened my mouth:  \n\n\"Is this the magic you wanted to teach me? The magic of transformation?\"  \n\n\"It is. I am most grateful to you for all your help over this long period.\"  \n\nShe bowed to me, her long silky black hair flowing down her shoulders like streams.  \nAlthough saying farewell to the little fox left emptiness in my heart, I soon became exhilarated at the thought of the transformation magic that I was about to learn. \n\nCould I transform into a flying bird once I'd mastered the magic? How high would I be able to fly? Maybe I could transform into a fish, and finally have the chance to go to Musk Reef.  \n\n\"I could even use magic to hunt!\" I couldn't contain my excitement. \"No more meatless carrot stews for me...\"  \n\n\"Then I shall ask you to stand still.\"  \n\nShe walked circles around me, her stature growing with every pass.  \n\nNo, not just her. The dandelions were also growing in size! They had only been at my ankles when she started, but now stretched to over my waist, growing as if turning into towering trees.  \n\nIt was only when I started to feel strange that I realized that the fox had become a giant.\n## volume xi\n\u003e \"Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land,\" the Fox chants. An unforgettable Mondstadt fairytale about a hunter and a fox. The Fox in the Dandelion Sea, the final installment.\n\nI started to feel strange, and then I noticed ‚Äî I had turned into a dandelion! \n\nEven if I wanted to protest, the dandelion had no mouth nor tongue for me to make a sound. All I could do was watch helplessly as the giant gently picked the dandelion plant from the ground and held it between her thumb and index finger.  \n\n\"Dandelion, Dandelion, ride the wind to a faraway land.\"  \n\nThe fox chanted.  \n\nAnd then with a puff, the dandelion seeds began to dance in the air. I was caught in a storm and whisked away to a distant sky. \n\nThe swirling made my head dizzy. Those eyes that glistened like gemstones in the lake had left me, along with my consciousness and the promise she had made.  \n\n\"Oh, Anemo Archon, I beg you to turn us into humans! For only then can we be safe from their hunting bows and knives.\"  \n\n---\n\nWhen I awoke, I found myself in the woods behind my village.  \n\nThe woods were full of lush trees, and at the center of the woods was a small lake.  \n\nThe lake was like the stained glass windows of Mondstadt Cathedral: crystal clear and shimmering in the sunlight.  \n\nThe sun shone through the treetops and glistened on the water's surface like fragments of gemstone. It was really something.  \n\nThe weather was cool that day. I was hunting in the forest when I arrived at the lake's edge. The shimmering water somehow reminded me of a girl I loved a long time ago.  \n\nI couldn't remember much about her, but felt that her eyes must have looked like the lake, glittering as if harboring fragments of gemstone within.  \n\nHmm. I must have lost myself in thought that day, drifting off into sleep as I watched the sparkling lake.","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.796971343Z","tags":null},"/notes/books/the-mondstadt-tower":{"title":"the mondstadt tower","content":"## volume i\n\u003e In the age of depression and tyranny, the outlander girl met the ominous orphan. Does this fateful encounter foretell a tragic ending? \n\u003e \n\u003e The historic romance novel, The Mondstadt Tower, begins!\n\nIn the time of the aristocrats, there stood a high tower in Mondstadt's plaza. It was built to honor Barbatos the Anemo Archon in name, yet in reality it was nothing more than a flamboyant display of wealth and power by the royals to gloat over the commoners. The one time in the year that the commoners living in these dark times could find a little solace was during Ludi Harpastum.  \n\nDuring one Ludi Harpastum, a wandering singer from a distant land arrived in the city. The name of the lass was In√®s, and everyone at the festival was enchanted by her stunning beauty. People of all ages and all walks of life vied to catch a glimpse of her throwing the Harpastum and to hear her sing foreign ballads.  \n  \n\"The blessings of Barbatos are for everyone! You are only sinful if you are bitter at such a joyous occasion!\"  \n  \nAs she sang these verses, she handed out her earnings during the festival to the poor and orphans in the city.  \n\nA frail figure stood among the crowds. He was the Seneschal, and he fell for her at first sight. But his religious piety filled him with a frustration at his inability to suppress the emotions he was experiencing, and her acts of charity, which violated the Church's right to aid to the poor, irked him all the more.  \n\nAs is known to all, the beliefs of contemporary Mondstadters hold that the Anemo Archon Barbatos encourages people to seek love and pursue freedom, but in the dark ages the Anemo Archon slept, and the city was tormented by the tyranny of the nobles, the poverty of the commoners, and the ravage of the dragon; meanwhile, the self-proclaimed \"orthodox\" church ‚Äî a mere figurehead, controlled by the ruling class ‚Äî advocated abstinence from earthly pleasures to avert divine punishment.\n\nUnder such circumstances, even the harp which symbolized the wind had been restricted to playing only those songs deemed \"holy.\" However, the notion of \"divine punishment\" was little more than an excuse fabricated by the nobles to conceal their avarice and restrict the commoners.  \n  \n\"To let her stay in the city is to bewitch all its inhabitants. What wickedness will this witch bring?\" The Seneschal pondered.  \n  \nAnd so, the Seneschal plotted to hunt down In√®s, and to confine her to the Cathedral while awaiting further instructions. As per the traditions of the time, the maiden chosen to throw the Harpastum should serve at the royal court for three days after the celebration, under the protection of the aristocrats. The Seneschal decided to send his adopted son, Octave, to sneak into the royal court and abduct In√®s. \n\nOctave was an unwelcome child, abandoned by his superstitious parents at birth and later raised by the Seneschal. As a child, he was persecuted and abused by the citizens, seen as a bad omen of draconic disasters. The only person who protected Octave was the Seneschal, who treated him like his own son and thus won his utmost trust.  \n  \n\"Bring the maiden who threw the Harpastum yesterday to me! Disturb no one and do not mention my name.\"  \n  \nUnder orders from the Seneschal, Octave climbed onto the balcony of the court chambers at nightfall.

This is part one, which tells the story of the Land of Night and the Moonlight Forest.\n\nIn the distant past, the Night Mother ruled over the faraway Land of Night. Here, no light touched the earth, nor did a single tree grow, and there was no life here but the horrendous denizens of the dark.  \n\nThe Night Mother was the source of all sins, and the Land of Night was the embodiment of her evilness. The cruel Night Mother, who had neither heart nor mouth, was always watching the Land of Night, and her punishments were always unexpected. The only thing she could not bear was the occasional ray of moonlight that made it through the clouds. The light that penetrated the walls of darkness always irritated her.  \n\nThe Moonlight Forest was the only place free from the rule of the Night Mother. Only there could the people bask in the bright moonlight and enjoy the grace it brought to the living. Everyone in the Kingdom of the Moonlight Forest was born with fair skin, light-colored hair, and bright blue eyes. Perhaps the constant lack of sunlight and the nourishment of the moonlight was the reason for their beauty, giving them an appearance different from the abhorrent creatures lurking at the edge of the forest.\n\n## volume ii\n\u003e A fairytale story that has been told throughout Teyvat for ages. This installment tells of the meeting of the Pale Princess and the Light Prince.\n\nThe monarch of this kingdom was a beautiful princess with skin as white as snow. Just like the [[notes/reference/motifs/moon|moon]], she had the brightest skin, the purest eyes, and the kindest soul. People of the kingdom all vowed their loyalty to her and referred to her as The Pale Princess. \n\nThe Pale Princess ruled her kingdom with kindness and gentleness. She always knew what was best for her people. Under her rule, the people of the Moonlight Forest never knew the threat of the Night Mother's wrath, and the creatures lurking in the dark never dared to set foot in the forest. \n\nHowever, the Princess had her own troubles. To her, the silvery [[notes/reference/motifs/moon|moon]] hanging in the night sky seemed like a¬†tiny¬†hole through which the light could pass, and she felt that by following the light back to its source one could almost see the world on the other¬†side. Just like all other people, the Pale Princess would often sit on the stone plate in front of the palace, imagining a world beyond the moonlight.  \n\"Will I be able to bring my people there one day?\" The Princess thought to herself. \n\n\"You will.\"  \n\nShe had not expected to hear an answer.  \n\nThe Princess turned and saw a young prince.\n\n## volume iii\n\u003e A fairytale story that has been told throughout Teyvat for ages. This installment tells of the Pale Princess and the Light Prince's decision to save the Moonlight Forest.\n\n\"I am the Prince of the Kingdom of Light from the other side of the world,\" the prince said to the shocked Princess.  \n\nThe Prince shone with an extraordinary light. The people of the Moonlight Forest had never seen such vitality. For as the¬†Prince strolled through the forest, life¬†flourished around him: new leaves sprouted and the Princess and her people grew stronger.  \n\nHe had come to save them. He would eventually save her from the darkness and take her to a kingdom free from all shadows. Although the Prince didn't say it explicitly, the Pale Princess had sensed the possibility of his arrival through her years of meditation.  \n\nSo, she asked.  \n\n\"What's the world like on the other side of the [[notes/reference/motifs/moon|moon]]?\"  \n\nThe Prince had already told her about the Kingdom of Light hundreds of times before, but at that moment, the Prince realized that she was determined to find out for herself.  \n\nSo, having sworn to save her people, the Princess and the Prince left the Moonlight Forest and walked hand in hand into the dark forest of the Land of Night.\n\n## volume iv\n\u003e A fairytale story that has been told throughout Teyvat for ages. Installment four describes the meeting between the Pale Princess, the Light Prince, and the Six Pygmies.\n\nHaving slogged across the swamp blazing with dark flames and passed the cave overgrown with poisonous mushrooms, the¬†Prince and¬†the Princess finally arrived at the Kingdom of Pygmies.  \n\n\"Princess of the Moonlight Forest, please save my five brothers. We will vow our loyalty to you in return for your kindness,\" begged a deformed pygmy who had just popped up from behind the branches.  \n\nThe kind Princess, sympathizing with the pygmies, promised to help them.  \nThey climbed up the dark mountains and saved the pygmy on the ridge, who was blind.  \n\n\"Oh,¬†silly me. I climbed all the way up here to try and get a better view.\" The blind pygmy apologized profusely.  \n\nThey dragged another pygmy out of the muddy wetland. This one was a fool.  \n\"Hehehe.\" The foolish pygmy thanked the Princess.  \n\nThey walked into the cave where the Nightgaunt resides and saved another pygmy, who was timid, from the top of a stalactite.  \n\n\"Not... not to brag, but I... I came here to have a fierce fight with the Night Mother's minions!\" The timid pygmy explained. \n\nThey set foot on a barren field and found a shrunken pygmy in the quicksand.  \n\"I wanted to see my garden but somehow got lost.\" Rubbing his withered palms, the shrunken pygmy grinned.  \n\nThey snuck into the nest of shadows and rescued a carefree pygmy from the clutches of carnivorous mushrooms.  \n\n\"I was out for a walk and somehow got trapped here.\" the carefree pygmy sighed.  \nOne by one, the Princess and the Prince saved the deformed pygmy's five brothers. The kind Princess said to them:  \n\n\"Now that you are all my people, please let me take you to the Kingdom of Light. It's a place that can bring sight to the blind, wisdom to the foolish, courage to the timid, and reinvigoration to the shrunken. As a princess, this is my gesture of gratitude to you.\"  \n\nOn hearing this, the pygmies were elated. To show their gratitude, they went along on the journey to serve the Prince and the Princess.\n\n## volume v\n\u003e A fairytale story that has been told throughout Teyvat for ages. In this installment, the Six Pygmies' sinister scheme starts to unfold.\n\nOn the surface, the six pygmies were true to the Princess and Prince, and followed them everywhere. But they were still heinous creatures from the Land of Night, and corruption flowed in their veins. As the days traveling to the Kingdom of Light grew long and dangerous, the root of evil would again blossom in their hearts.  \n\nFear gave root to malice, and out of malice grew evil scheming. The six pygmies started to devise their nasty plot.  \n\nThe blind pygmy opened his sightless eyes and enjoyed the sunlight greedily.  \n\"Why not¬†keep the¬†Prince with us forever? Instead of believing in unfathomable promises, securing the sunlight before us is our best bet.\"  \n\nThe foolish pygmy gently patted his scabies-ridden head and gulped the light-filled air rapaciously.  \n\n\"Hehehe, I... I think we should kidnap the Prince and use... use him to make us smarter. That's the smart way!\"  \n\nThe timid pygmy swung his tiny fists in the air and yelled.  \n\n\"All that rascal did was save our lives and now he acts so condescendingly, treating us like servants. I shall challenge him to a duel!\"  \n\nThe shrunken pygmy squinted in disdain. His complexion wrinkled up like a piece of crumpled paper.  \n\n\"Brothers, you have been hiding in the shadows for too long. The darkness has clouded your judgment. It is new life that we need in order to survive. I say we use the corpse of the Prince as fertilizer so my garden might flourish again.\"  \n\nThe carefree pygmy sighed and looked sullen.  \n\n\"We'd better get this over with quickly... If it weren't for them, these evil thoughts wouldn't have entered my mind, and I wouldn't have become so somber.\"\n\nThere was one pygmy who did not join the discussion. This is not because he was not evil, but because the guilt of betraying his savior overcame his wicked nature enough to make him keep his mouth shut. He couldn't even say a single word. \n\nNevertheless, the guilt could not completely suppress his corrupt nature and the pygmies all agreed to the scheme. They decided to poison the Prince's water.\n\n## volume vi\n\u003e A fairytale story that has been told throughout Teyvat for ages. This installment tells of how the Six Pygmies managed to implement their nefarious plot.\n\nAt that moment, the Pale Princess was in a deep slumber and had not an inkling of how the pygmies had played her and her lover for fools. Under the cover of the night sky, the six pygmies made their first move.  \n\nThe poison had sent the Prince into a coma as the Pale Princess slept. The six pygmies' scheme started to unfold.  \n\nIn her sleep, the Princess had no idea how the Prince was being tortured. In her dream, her lover's body glowed with luminous colors and light scattered gently like satin. The sweet sunlight finally broke through the dark clouds and sprinkled on the living. The orange glow of the setting [[notes/reference/motifs/sun|sun]] painted a layer of caramel on the blue lake, making the water as sweet as nectar. New colors were painted on the black hills and the ruined city was turned into a candy castle. However, when the Princess called the Prince by name, all she heard in reply were indistinguishable words.  \n\nThe poor Princess had no idea that the Prince could no longer respond to her calling.  \nLightning flashed and thunder echoed in the silent night sky. The six pygmies carried out their scheme successfully. To celebrate, they set up a huge pot and cooked a pot of thick soup with moss and poisonous mushrooms. But just as the culprits were enjoying their feast, the Prince's broken soul used up all its remaining power to curse the pygmies. For the rest of their lives, they were tormented by a curse that made them feel as if they were being cooked in a huge cooking pot, unable to ever see the light of day again.  \n\nHowever, during the celebration, one of the pygmies wrapped the Prince in the dirty tablecloth, intent on carrying him back to the dark forest to seek help from the Princess, hoping to wake him up. No one knows if this was out of a lingering sense of loyalty to the Princess, or simply¬†born of his fear of the curse.\n\n## volume vii\n\u003e A fairytale story that has been told throughout Teyvat for ages. The final installment brings everything to a conclusion, and includes the Night Mother's prophecy.\n\nThis pygmy spirited the Prince's body away from his wicked brethren, plunging into the damp bushes. Following animal tracks, he searched for the Fountain of Purity where the Pale Princess slept.  \n  \nWhat the pygmy didn't know is that the vicious Night Mother had already found the Princess. She followed the pygmy stealthily, like a wild cat stalking its prey, her shadowy figure blotting out the moonlight and starlight.  \n\nWhen the pygmy arrived, the Princess was already gone. The sorrowful howl of a night owl was heard as the Night Mother arose from the now-corrupt fountain.  \n\"Pitiful creature, are you here to see your master?\" The vile smirk of the Night Mother exuded the breath of the [[notes/places/abyss|abyss]].  \n\n\"If so, I'm afraid all you will find here is despair, you sad little thing.\"  \n\n\"That foolish princess is now in chains. I destroyed the Moonlight Kingdom and cursed her people before her eyes. They will be in an undead state, lingering at the point between life and death forevermore. No soul and no moonlight.\" The words of the Night Mother landed like cold raindrops on a forgotten tomb.  \n\n\"Look at you, you poor pygmy. I wonder what your master will think when she finds out what you have done.\"  \n\nFear crawled through the pygmy's veins and grabbed his feeble heart.  \n\nThe Night Mother left the pygmy to wallow in grief. But first ‚Äî whether out of some hitherto unknown sense of pity, or simply to see him suffer more, we shall never know ‚Äî the Night Mother left a glimpse of hope for the wretched pygmy.  \n\n\"In thousands of years time, my greatest foe will descend. He wields a sword that heralds the dawn and wears armor that can reflect the shining sunlight. He shall destroy my kingdom and bring the Prince back to life. The Princess will then be free from her eternal torment. Until then, I fear not a single soul in the Land of Night, for nothing will bring an end to my kingdom except for the catastrophe foretold by the prophecy. As for you, the treacherous slave that poisoned his master... fate shall see that you get what you deserve.\"  \n\nThe Night Mother then collapsed and became a pile of sludge consisting of mud and worms.  \n\nDevastated, the pygmy wandered around in sorrow and regret. He hid the body in a tree hole and walked off alone into the night, and into a self-imposed exile.","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.796971343Z","tags":null},"/notes/books/veras-melancholy":{"title":"vera's melancholy","content":"## volume i\n\u003e I don't ever think the world is monotonous. It's just that interesting things happen in far away galaxies. \n\u003e \n\u003e The great adventure of Vera, an ordinary girl always fascinated by distant lands, secretly begins.\n\n### Endless Days in Infinite Worlds\n\"There are times when I think to myself... There's nothing to do in this tiny village. What a dull place to live.\"  \n\nThis wasn't the first time that Vera had complained about her hometown, the small country village of Delphi. Her frown eased slightly as she lay on the hillside near the village, eyes closed, feeling the breeze of the early summer.  \n\n\"Then where in this world would you not consider dull?\" Her buddy Sachi asked curiously.  \n\nVera sat up and leaned forward.  \n\n\"I believe on the other side of the Starry Sea is a planet inhabited by gods who can answer all prayers and wishes, and everyone bearing a wish is on a journey to get there. I believe, in our universe, there is a world currently in a war against doomsday, where the noble and elegant souls of fourteen Valkyries burn bright, if only for a brief but magnificent moment...\"  \n\n\"You've been reading too many of those weird fantasy novels.\"  \n\n\"But... this village really IS dull. When was the last time anything fun happened here?\"  \n\n\"Funny you should say that, a new family did move into our village recently...\"  \n\n\"Novelty and fun aren't the same thing!\"  \n\nDespite what she had said, Vera decided to pay a visit to the newcomers. Sachi, however, remembered his family's rules, and walked back home for dinner.  \n  \n---\n\nVera gave the door to the newcomer's abode a gentle push. Much to her surprise, it wasn't locked.  \n\n\"Anybody home?\"  \n\nNo sooner had the words left her mouth than the living room cupboard doors flew open and out jumped a black-haired boy wearing glasses. He was followed by a tentacled blue slime. \n\n\"Make way! Tal, why did you let a stranger in?\"  \n\nThe black-haired boy gently pushed Vera out of his way and picked up an axe by the door.  \n\n\"You leave me with no choice. Since you have seen everything, there is only one thing for it...\"  \n\nThus began the biggest crisis of Vera's life.\n\n## volume ii\n\u003e Everything's just boring. Everything, all the time. It's not depression. It's just reaching the age of 14. \n\u003e \n\u003e So begins Vera's adventure.\n\n### My Backyard is Slightly Bigger than the Entire Universe\n\"All I can do now is ask you to help me.\" The black-haired boy, who called himself Ike, handed Vera a kitchen knife.  \n\nHe walked back to the cupboard and began slashing at the tentacles frantically. \n\n\"Come and help me close this door! If a tentacle starts attacking you, use this kitchen knife to defend yourself!\" Ike's glasses were now covered in blue slime. \"Hurry! We can't let this evil demon cross into Delphi.\"  \n\nUpon hearing his words, Vera helped Ike close the door. While they were pushing back the tentacles, Vera accidentally stabbed Ike twice in the back. Thankfully, Ike's healing spells were quite potent.  \n\n\"I shall explain everything to you. I am in fact over a thousand years old, and this door is a gateway to anywhere in the universe. That tentacled monster is an old one from the Large Magellanic Cloud ‚Äî I went there to get something.\" Ike was covered in slime from head to foot by this point. He wiped his glasses with Vera's dress as he spoke. \"Erm... is there anything else that you'd like to know?\"  \n\n\"Who's Tal?\" Vera didn't seem to mind.  \n\n\"An evil spirit that resided in the man-devouring castle. It has served me as a butler since I subdued it. Strangely, it behaved quite friendly towards you.\"  \n\n---\n  \nVera's parents always reminded her that people are destined to build families, and that it was futile to entertain dreams of anything beyond the homestead. Her buddy Sachi once told her that if a lively girl like her was to marry someone from a faraway land, the whole village would become unbearably lonely.  \n\n(The real reason Sachi said this was that he was something of a weakling, and was sure to be ferociously bullied if he ended up having to play with the boys.)  \n\n\"The human spirit is still too immature. I need to guide you both through the wonders of your childhood.\" Ike extended his inviting arms to Vera. \"You will sing every step of the way on your long journey to youth.\"  \n\nFrom the Orion Arm to the Eternal Jahanam, from the Torrents of Time to the depths of the Starry Sea...  \n\n\"How far is 'beyond'? Any place in this universe is just as boring as my backyard,\" he said.  \n\n\"The scale of everything beyond follows the heart,\" Ike replied. \"Thus, my heart is slightly bigger than the entire universe.\"\n\n## volume iii\n\u003e The Andromeda Empire stretches across half the galaxy group. Every planet within the Empire has its own demons and deities, dragons and monsters. \n\u003e \n\u003e \"I've come up with a story for every star from your home.\" \"That's not possible. Looking from here, the Andromeda Galaxy is only one fifth the size of your [[notes/reference/motifs/moon|moon]].\" \n\u003e \n\u003e So continues Vera's adventure.\n\n### The Man Who Stole the Lone Star\n\"I am the second rightful heir to the Andromeda Empire, and I have more than two hundred titles to my name. You shall call me the Princess Andro-Basilisks.\" The charming girl then crossed her arms, savoring the moment of her entrance in her mind and giggling to herself in amusement.  \n\nHer sole reason for gracing Delphi with her presence was to marry Ike.  \n\n\"If you, he who conquered a quarter of the universe, marry me, my safety shall be guaranteed after my elder sister takes the throne.\"  \n\n\"If I may ask, how big is the Andromeda Empire?\" Vera asked.  \n\n\"I reckon there are more than nine thousand inhabitable planets.\"  \n\n‚Äî‚ÄîWith so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance?  \n\n---\n  \n\"So you aren't here to harm Vera?\" Sachi cautiously asked Ike, who was carrying the scrolls and globes of other planets.  \n\n\"Of course not. I think she would make a great assistant.\" After putting everything down, he clapped his hands. \"You like her?\"  \n\n\"Me? No, not at all, I don't like her at all!\" Sachi looked away, worried that the old sage might discern his true feelings.  \n\nHe reached for a box full of photo frames. He grabbed a few at random, each picture depicting a different beauty.  \n\n\"Look at them... They all said that they gave me their one and only true love, but did they? In reality, I was just one of their many lovers.\"  \n\nSachi did not know when or where he had heard the saying, but it blurted out from his mouth in his moment of annoyance:  \n\n\"With so many stars in your possession, why come to steal my brilliance?\"\n\n## volume iv\n\u003e There is a saying that goes as follows: Not all that glitters is gold, sometimes it is the outpouring of a broken heart. \n\u003e \n\u003e Either way, the stars in the sky certainly aren't made of gold, and most people's hearts aren't made of glass. \n\u003e \n\u003e In any case ‚Äî here is the next chapter of Vera's adventure!\n\n### All that Glitters\n\"The people in these photographs are all so pretty,\" Vera exclaimed as she picked up Ike's box of framed photos.  \n\n\"Of course they are ‚Äî otherwise, they wouldn't have had the chance to leave me with a photograph to remember them by.\"  \n\nIke had no intention of evading. After all, he was a galactic sage who was over a thousand years old. So of course he knew that girls were easily hurt, and that they could become trouble very easily. Ike would thus never cheat a girl ‚Äî take notes, boys.  \n\n\"Having seen the starry host, I thus make star-shaped jewels to remember them by,\" he continued to explain. \"But those stars that shine across the universe do not belong to anyone. So it is also impossible to steal them.\"  \n\nVera did not understand. \"What are you saying?\"  \n\n\"I'm saying this for the sake of a foolish fellow who isn't present right now. Pay it no mind, humans are just far too young.\"  \n\n---\n  \n\"I will serve as a go-between between you and Ike.\" Sachi said to the Princess of the Andromeda Empire in a loud voice.  \n\n\"Huh?\"  \n\n\"I love Vera, I don't‚Äî\"  \n\n\"Disgusting. Boring. Be silent, worm. You are an offense to my ears. I've already acknowledged Vera as my friend. I will not hand her over to a cowardly person like you...\"  \n\n\"Wh‚ÄîWhat...\"\n## volume v\n\u003e You can't have picnics on the sides of a galactic highway! Even the deities will be held fully responsible for road accidents that might occur! \n\u003e \n\u003e The doorway to a study in a simple village connects to anywhere in space and time! Having tea with the deities, playing hide-and-seek across time... Vera's great adventure continues!\n\n### Roadside Picnic\nWhen Ike was taking a nap, his servants waged a terrible war against each other.  \nThe great wizard had subdued many gods and demons to serve under him. As the most formidable wizard of his day, Ike was in command of gods and demons more numerous than the entries in a dictionary. But who was the strongest of those under his rule? The gods and demons decided to find out for themselves through battle.  \n\nUnfortunately, they seemed to have erroneously regarded as their own three who were neither gods nor demons: the Princess, Sachi, and Vera.  \n\nIke only slept for two hours, but in that time three stars had already been destroyed!  \n\n---\n  \n\"Why should I protect you?\" The Princess pulled her hand away, and the giant demon plummeted to the ground, its eyeballs gone.  \n\nThe dominant race of the Andromeda Empire may look lovely and sweet, but on their palms grow two special mouths, which they use to devour the eyeballs of their lovers and those they vanquish.  \n\n\"Are we not friends?\" Vera wiped the blood off her face, and appeared to be hurt by the Princess' words.  \n\n\"Yea ‚Äì yes,\" The Princess blushed and looked away. \"I already regard you as my only friend for what has happened. I was not referring to you, Vera.\"  \n\n\"No!\" Sachi yelled as the gnarly jaws of a dragon closed around him.  \n\n\"Do you surrender to me now?\" The giant dragon jeered. \"Surrender and concede that you are worthless, lowly rats, and I shall let you live!\"  \n\n\"I surrender! I surrender! Let me go!\" Sachi screamed.  \n\n\"Why, a lizard of your despicable breed should know better than to utter such foolish words! Even the geckos in my palace could crush you.\" The Princess gave her wrists a twirl.  \n\n\"No! This has nothing to do with me!\" Sachi yelled as the dragon cast him into the sky.  \n\nAnd just like that, the battle between the dominant species of Andromeda and the ancient giant dragon was over.  \n\n---\n  \nThe moral? You won't get hurt if you just surrender.  \n\nSachi was knocked out of the contest and woke Ike up with the slap of a slipper. Vera also survived thanks to the protection of the Princess.  \n\n\"Argh! You imbecile! The mere sight of you is revolting. Do not come near me! Don't talk to me, don't look at me, nor breathe the same air as me, you lowly scum!\" The Princess could not have a lower opinion of Sachi.\n\n## volume vi\n\u003e There was once a great scholar who wished to write a book about all the festive days of the empire. \n\u003e \n\u003e After looking into it more closely, he discovered that every single day had some sort of a festival associated with it... He persevered with this monumental writing task for six months before giving up on it. \n\u003e \n\u003e But don't worry ‚Äî as far as this book is concerned, I am the author, and I won't let my readers down!\n\n### For Every Season\nThough those things had indeed happened, they were occurrences on a galactic scale. Now, something more mundane was about to happen. The date of the town festival was drawing near.  \n\n\"I suppose it's finally my turn to introduce you two to this small town, then?\" Vera said as she served the Princess and Ike her very own braised dishes.  \n\nAfter all, those things they had encountered in their galactic escapades had to be explained by the Princess and Ike. If there was any knowledge Vera had to present to them, it was the knowledge of her hometown.  \n\n\"...Afterward, the great king's first messenger, the brave knight Huffman strode west across two continents, crossing great oceans and rivers. As for the imperial sage, the witch from the east, she passed by her hometown on her road eastward, and then came by the land of the Nether. Thus, they finally met here.\"  \n\n\"Huh, is that so. How interesting.\" Though she was trying hard not to let Vera notice that she did not in fact care for the story at all, the Princess' acting skills required some work.  \n\n\"So that can only mean that this place is on the polar opposite side of this world from the great king's capital, right?\" Ike said, commenting on a seemingly unimportant aspect of the tale.  \n\n\"Ahahaha, that's true if you think about it.\" Vera rubbed the back of her head with a crooked smile. \n\n---\n  \n\"I've always said that I want to leave this place, but in the end, I discovered that this is the place that I'm most familiar with.\" Having come to this realization on the eve of the town's anniversary, Vera began crying right in front of Sachi's eyes. \n\n\"You numbskull! You made Vera cry!\" The Princess made her entry with a flying kick, sending Sachi hurtling away.\n## volume vii\n\u003e In the star clusters at the outer reaches of the universe, habitable planets are few and far between. For this reason, the region is the playground of space captains and pirates alone. \n\u003e \n\u003e With this being the universe, though, there is no port and starboard in the traditional sense ‚Äî out here, \"starboard\" means whichever side of your spacecraft is oriented towards the star you are using for navigation... \n\u003e \n\u003e Lose yourself, and especially your sense of direction, in this next chapter of Vera's starbound voyage!\n\n### Galaxy Wars\n\"Re-igniting a [[notes/reference/motifs/sun|sun]] is not difficult, but I don't think the Andromeda Empire would like to see that happen,\" Ike said to the panicked Vera.  \n\n\"Do you mean that the Princess has kidnapped Sachi?\" Vera said with some shock in her voice after giving the matter some thought.  \n\n\"How did you come to that conclusion? I'm saying that only the Andromeda Empire would be capable of kidnapping you and the Princess.\" Ike then turned to face the innumerable lives that dwelled within the galaxy.  \n\nHe paused for a moment before declaring thus: \"Inhabitants of the galaxy. Though I have come here upon the invitation of the High Saint King Lebannin to re-ignite the flames of the few remaining stars, it seems that the Andromeda Empire does not wish for your longevity, and has thus kidnapped my friend.\"  \n\n\"Are you then to put their lives over that of all life?\" Saint King Lebannin arose from her seat. \"If that is the case, why then do I rule over these stars?\"  \n\n---\n  \nFinally, the Saint King would charge into peril alone, defeat the assassins from the Andromeda Empire, and rescue both the Princess and Sachi. Afterward, she had a few words with Ike.  \n\n\"I didn't think you could defeat the dominant species of Andromeda,\" Ike praised.\n\n\"They're a strong and hardy race. I suppose it's true, then, that you defeated the holy dragon en route to becoming the Saint King.\"  \n\n\"I am, in fact, that same holy dragon. I fused with Lebannin's flesh and blood, and now act according to her wishes.\"  \n\n\"Huh...\" Ike was a little shocked by this.  \n\n\"Ah, yes. Is that fellow the person the Second Princess is fond of? When I barged in, they were...\"  \n\n\"What!?\" Now that was a much bigger shock for Ike.\n## volume viii\n\u003e Of course boys aren't invited to the girl's slumber party! Girls are sacrosanct, like the gods of the golden age. \n\u003e \n\u003e Vera, the Princess, Saint King Lebannin, and Ur, alpha female of the Galactic Swarm, shall talk deep into the night!\n\n### The Girls Themselves\n\"I said it was a misunderstanding! She was about to eat me.\" Sachi explained.  \n\n\"I don't think she was intending to eat you,\" Ike said, pushing his glasses up. \"The dominant race of the Andromeda Empire have organs on the palms of their hands that allow them to capture and consume eyeballs.\"  \n\n\"I've seen it before. Looks like some sort of... lamprey?\" Sachi shivered a little as he said that last word.  \n\n\"Let me finish.\" Ike wanted to touch his eyes, but wound up pressing his fingerprint into his glasses. Taking his glasses off, he touched his left eye. \"Their practice of eating eyes has two meanings: submission...\"  \n\nHe touched his right eye. \"...and love.\"  \n\nSachi also began to rub both his eyes, thinking about which it was back then.  \n\n\"Whatever the case, I don't think the princess really understands the difference. Those who submit to her, those things she conquers, those who love her ‚Äî they're all the same to her. People who can't hurt her in an imperial succession battle.\"  \n\n\"Huh. No wonder those Andromeda Empire assassins kidnapped her. Two birds with one stone, eh?\"  \n\n\"I'm not getting involved in their succession wars. I can only help you support her better.\"  \n\n\"Hey now ‚Äî we're not like that! I mean, doesn't she hate me the most?\"  \n\n---\n  \nAnd what were the girls talking about at this very moment? That may yet be an eternal mystery.\n## volume ix\n\u003e \"Vera's so beautiful, like a shining star in the universe, but I...\" \"Boys at this age are always more petite than girls of a similar age.\" \n\u003e \n\u003e Childhood must be let go of to welcome the coming of the adolescent years. It's not too late to think about it now... Real melancholy finally hits Vera.\n\n### Death Awaits in Abyssal Waves\nAs Vera and Sachi grew up, the chemistry between the four changed in subtle and inexplicable ways.  \n\n\"Enough with excuses,\" Sachi said to Ike. \"Vera will not cease pursuing you even if you never reciprocate her feelings.\"  \n\nIke was a symbol of a faraway land. He stood for the unknown, for that which was waiting to be discovered. A brave bird would never nest there, but would be forever adrift in the winds of admiration.  \n\nIke retorted, \"No matter which way you look at it, being a thousand years old makes you an elderly person.\"  \n\n\"Then we are well-matched in age.\" The Princess merrily chipped in on their conversation.  \n\n---\n  \nWhen Sachi finally mustered the courage to declare his love, he met with the most dreadful fate.  \n\nRemember the ancient sword that Ike and Vera received from the old ones when they first met? It was what Ike needed to propel destiny forward! But now, Vera had her finger slit by its blade, and a malicious ancient virus sapped the life out of her.  \n\n---\n  \n\"This is all your fault!\" Sachi grabbed Ike by the collar. If the tragedy had not happened, Ike would have laughed it off, for he was a gentle soul. But this time, he slapped Sachi's hand away.  \n\n\"Don't you know how to rewind time? Please! Do it to save Vera!\" Even the Princess begged.  \n\n\"You don't understand. Only the future can save the past, not the other way around.\" Ike bit his lip until blood came flowing down.  \n\n---\n  \n\"A local myth speaks of a Silver Age when people enjoyed a seemingly endless childhood that could last up to two hundred years. This only made their short maturity a pain to bear.\"  \n\nTo the others, childhood was long gone, but youth was forever beyond their reach.  \nTo be continued in \"Vera's Melancholy\" without Vera.\n\n## volume x\n\u003e \"It's enough. Let's go home... The furthest place I've dreamt of, is the Delphi where you are.\" \n\u003e \n\u003e Though the explanation is delayed, you should know that Delphi is the center of Greek mythology. Vera's Melancholy - the perfect ending... or is it?\n\n### Vera's Melancholy\nTo revive Vera, Sachi, Ike and the Princess embarked on a spectacular and thrilling journey that lasted twenty years. From battling Signor Inferno to slaying the Star Devourer, the trio had even rescued two galaxies and the Galaxy Empire, and eliminated four species of ruthless interstellar worms along the way.  \n\nWhen Vera opened her eyes, she found herself in the arms of Sachi, now a hero of cosmic proportions.  \n\nTo the dominant species of Andromeda, twenty years was nothing more than a few seconds. The Princess looked lovely as always, but her countenance was a curious mix of genuine happiness and loss.  \n\nSachi, having lost an eye in his adventures, was now a tall and strapping young man. His flowing tears soaked into Vera's shoulders ‚Äî though still prone to tears, he was no longer his feeble-minded self.  \n\nThe years had been kind to Ike, who after all this time still had that same old smile on his face.  \n\n\"I am but an echo of time,\" Ike said as he began his preparations. \"As I've said, the past cannot change the future, for the predetermined rules of equilibrium are slightly more powerful than me. But the future, with its infinite possibilities, could save the world.\"  \n\n---\n  \nIke transformed Sachi back into who he was twenty years ago, and time reversed itself to the day of their departure. Everything seemed to remain unchanged between the four, though they realized that the innocence they once shared was one thing that could never return.  \n\n\"I am sorry for depriving you of your childhood,\" Ike said to him. \"Now go, the youth that you deserve awaits.\"  \n\n\"I have witnessed every wonder in the universe for your sake, and this was how my childhood ended.\" Sachi summoned every last ounce of his courage as he stood before the girl of his destiny. \"I will never reach my youth without you by my side.\" \n\n---\n  \nWhat will her answer be?  \n\n**Editor's note:** The author of \"Vera's Melancholy\" is now off living the high life with the royalties from the first nine volumes.

Eberhart would eventually turn on him, forcing him to flee to¬†Liyue¬†in disgrace. He joined the Skipper's crew and eventually met his end in battle against the sea monster that the Skipper sought to take revenge on. \n\nthe [[heart of depth]] artifact set tells the story of his travels with the skipper.\n\n[[the exile]] set might also be about parsifal but it gets a little muddy. first, it‚Äôs unclear if parsifal was exiled from mondstadt or if just chose to leave. second, the exile‚Äôs goblet was a family heirloom of the exile \u0026 it says he carved out the gem himself, whereas all the other parsifal lore says *he* carved out the sapphire of a goblet he stole from some noble house. who knows! could be another exiled aristocrat, but a lot of the details do seem to match up.\n\n## blue-eyed spear witch\nsometime while parsifal was in mondstadt, he met the **[[blue-eyed spear witch]]**‚Äîwho was a servant for an aristocratic family at the time.\n\n\u003e he was leaving a mansion with stolen goods and noticed a woman in a window whose eyes were as blue as the gem in the silver cup he had just stolen. Struck by her beauty, he climbed up to her, pried the blue gem out of the silver cup and gave it to her as a gift.\n\n\u003e Unfortunately, this blue gem had the crest of the ruling family on it, and when the woman's master found out she had it, she was punished, which caused her to become angry at Parsifal despite still being in love with him. The next time they met she warned that someday she would pay him back for the scars inflicted on her due to his actions, and they seemingly never met again.\n\nat some point before leaving mondstadt, parsifal stopped at the shop in [[heart‚Äôs desire (sapphire)]] to buy ‚Äúthe special [[wine]] that helps you forget about the one you long for‚Äù but it has already been purchased by the blue-eyed spear witch, who exchanged the sapphire he gave her for the wine.\n\nthe [[wine and song]] catalyst description tells the story of them meeting but gives them a happy ending where they went to explore the world together‚Äî‚ÄúFor no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.‚Äù\n\nsupposedly, eberhart was trained by the blue-eyed spear witch after parsifal left mondstadt \u0026 later killed her‚Äîi don‚Äôt think it explicitly says anywhere that she died, but it‚Äôs heavily implied in the [[crescent pike]] weapon description\n\none other thing that i‚Äôm still not sure about that swirls around in my head a lot is the [[hex and hound]] book, which is about two shapeshifting sisters, one of which has blue eyes. i think it‚Äôs possible this is the blue-eyed spear witch, and if *that‚Äôs* true i think it‚Äôs possible she survived.\n\n## eberhart\neberhart was the half-brother of parsifal \u0026 ingbert‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhe resented his noble lineage \u0026 wanted to ‚Äúrecapture the glory and pride of ancient nobility‚Äù and ‚Äúdestroy these rotten foundations.‚Äù[^1]\n\nhe was the owner of the unnamed gladiator that was killed by [[vennessa]] from the [[gladiator]] artifact set (to give you a sense of the timeline).\n\nhe went on an expedition to [[dragonspine]] with ingbert \u0026 and a few other aristocrats‚Äîon this expedition, he laid traps \u0026 killed the others. he was supposedly gravely wounded, and we‚Äôre not sure if he lived / made it back to mondstadt.\n\nlater, he became the [[blue-eyed spear witch]]‚Äôs disciple (knowing she was in love with parsifal) ‚Äúto learn the fatal loophole in her art, all the better to slay her with‚Ä¶‚Äù \u0026 killed her[^1]\n\n\u003e So what if those who came after should despise me? I will do anything to achieve my goals.\n\n\n## the many versions of parsifal\nparsifal is an [[opera]] written by richard wagner, based on the arthurian story parzival that was written about a character named percival. are we taking notes.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e **important to note:** genshin *loves* wagner. they are obsessed with this guy. \n\n\n### percival\nthe original percival was one of the knights of the round table in arthurian legend, and was the hero in the quest for the holy grail (before later being replaced by galahad).\n\nto be honest, the story of percival doesn‚Äôt seem to have a ton in common with genshin‚Äôs parsifal: percival comes across the fisher king, who is wounded; if he asks the king a particular ‚Äúhealing question,‚Äù he can heal the king \u0026 save his kingdom \u0026 get the holy grail etc; he doesn‚Äôt know this, so he doesn‚Äôt ask the question.\n\nin most versions, percival‚Äôs mother hides him in the woods when he‚Äôs born because she doesn‚Äôt want him to become a knight like his father or something, but then 3 knights come across them and i guess he thinks they‚Äôre so cool he wants to be a knight too. he leaves, \u0026 his mother usually dies of grief. fun stuff!\n\n### parzival\nin **parzival**, the story continues past his initial failure to ask the healing question \u0026 leads to him becoming the grail king. one interesting thing in this version is that the fisher king gets a name, anfortas, which is also the name of the leader of the [[schwanenritter]] (swan knights) in [[content/notes/places/khaenriah|khaenri'ah]]. \n\n### parsifal\nthe opera version is called **parsifal**, ‚Äúinformed by one of the theories about the name percival, according to which it is of persian origin, meaning ‚Äòpure (or poor) fool‚Äô‚Äù‚Äîwhenever the word fool comes up i obviously think of the [[fatui]].\n\nanyway! in this version, the fisher king (now named amfortas) was stabbed with the holy spear, and it basically turns out that parsifal is fated to find the spear \u0026 heal his wound. this version also gives more of a backstory to his injury‚Äîamfortas had the holy spear, but lost it \u0026 was stabbed with it in battle because he got distracted by a pretty lady.\n\nthere is a LOT going on in this opera \u0026 it‚Äôs all really cool and definitely shares themes with genshin but it‚Äôs too much to get into right now‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhopefully i'll get a chance to revisit this later.\n\n## lohengrin\ngood news, the parzival character also shows up in ANOTHER wagner [[opera]] called lohengrin, which is based on the story lohengrin, which is a sequel to parzival. isn‚Äôt this fun.\n\nlohengrin is the son of parzival, and he is ‚Äúa grail knight sent in a boat pulled by swans to rescue a maiden who can never ask his identity‚Äù‚Äîthis is basically just a variation of the classic knight of the swan story. in one of the original swan knight stories, the name of the swan knight is helias. ([[content/notes/reference/motifs/sun|sun]] god!)\n\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e the knight of the swan story also ties into melusines, which we'll apparently be seeing in fontaine. the whole never-ask-my-name thing \u0026 related variations has come up a lot in genshin‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhopefully i will remember to compile some notes on it at some point.\n\n\nlohengrin‚Äôs twin brother inherits their father parzival‚Äôs land while lohengrin is sent out as a grail knight ‚Äúin secret‚Äù to help kingdoms that have lost their protectors. he shows up in a kingdom without a male heir \u0026 offers marry the duchess there \u0026 defend the kingdom, on the condition that she must never ask his name. all is good for a few years, but then she asks the question \u0026 he gets right back on his swan boat and never returns.\n\nin the opera, the reason lohengrin shows up \u0026 has to defend the duchess is because she‚Äôs being wrongfully accused of murdering her brother‚Äîin the end, it turns out the swan from the swan boat is her brother, who was cursed by a witch lol.\n\n## irish myth stuff\nvia wikipedia:\n\u003e There are possible parallels in¬†*Perceval*¬†with the Irish mythological race of the¬†[Tuatha D√© Danann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann). The race has three central talismans, a spear, a cauldron, and a sword, that correlate with the spear, grail, and sword present in¬†*Perceval*.[^ ]Chr√©tien's¬†*Perceval*¬†also includes many similarities to the Irish saga¬†*[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boyhood_Deeds_of_Fionn)*. The main character,¬†[Fionn mac Cumhaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill), is raised in isolation and undergoes many adventures akin to those of Perceval, suggesting that the narrative may have been a source of inspiration for Chr√©tien.\n\n\nwithout getting too in the weeds here because this is all a story for another day, i have a suspicion that [[fontaine]] is going to incorporate a lot of stuff from irish mythology. especially that last character, fionn.\n\nfor now, just know that irish mythology is divided into four cycles: the mythological cycle, the ulster cycle, the fianna cycle, and the kings‚Äô cycle. the ulster cycle in particular is mostly about a hero named cu chulainn, who manymanymany people have speculated was a source of inspiration for [[notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]].\n\ncu chulainn was trained by a warrior woman named scathach (possibly [[skirk]]!) who gave him his spear, gae bulg‚Äîthe description of the spear is honestly not too far off from childe's hydro weapons‚Äîand he basically becomes this insane hero at a young age who turns into ‚Äúan unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe‚Äù when fights. (like literally, that is not a metaphor, he becomes a monster. very foul legacy of him.)\n\n## childe\nthis is farfetched, but i basically have a theory that [[notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]] is somehow a distant descendant of parsifal and the blue-eyed spear witch‚Äîthe resemblance of the heart of depth guy, the fact that he uses the [[freedom talent books]] from mondstadt, the dead blue eyes.\n\nlet it be known that i had this theory first but ashikai has [a good video]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPUcllAoxFo\u0026pp=ygUOYXNoaWthaSBjaGlsZGU%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPUcllAoxFo\u0026pp=ygUOYXNoaWthaSBjaGlsZGU%3D)) about it that i think will cover everything quicker \u0026 more efficiently than i can.\n\n## dragonspine\ni find it really interesting that [[notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]], parsifal, and eberhart all have ties to [[dragonspine]]:\n- the [[heart of depth]] artifact set, which tells parsifal's story, is in a dragonspine domain\n- eberhart led that fateful expedition to dragonspine\n- childe is shown in dragonspine in one of his character videos\n- [[durin]]'s corrupted heart being in dragonspine reminds me a lot of whatever is going on with childe re: foul legacy \u0026 the [[content/notes/places/abyss|abyss]]\n- for some reason, the battle music in dragonspine is [all-conquering tide](https://open.spotify.com/track/5BVQORtwCg5PtOUG5GR9B5?si=be8e6c36e63145c2)‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâa song that‚Äôs pretty clearly associated with childe, was in the domain in his story quest, and is not even on the dragonspine album\n\n[^1]: via favonius lance description","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.796971343Z","tags":null},"/notes/characters/playable/childe":{"title":"childe","content":"\n## names\n### ajax\nthe name \"ajax\" comes from [the greek hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_the_Great?useskin=vector) who fought with the achaeans in the trojan war. he's portrayed as being a very strong, skilled fighter but also kind of an arrogant, silly little jock boy. he also has a brother named teucer!\n\nobviously, he's mentioned in the iliad. he's also a prominent character in [troilus and cressida](https://shakespeare.mit.edu/troilus_cressida/full.html), where he is chosen to fight hector in one-on-one combat in place of achilles, who is busy wallowing and being depressed. (achilles does end up killing hector to avenge patroclus, before being killed himself.) the other greeks spend a lot of time making fun of him in this play‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâit's honestly very funny, and i recommend reading it.\n\nas with all other names pulled from greek mythology in genshin, we can assume the name ajax comes from [[notes/places/enkanomiya|enkanomiya]] (or the ancient [[unified civilization]], of which enkanomiya was just a part). this + his weapon looking suspiciously like the ones all over enkanomiya is pretty interesting. \n\n#### sophocles\ni also recommend reading sophocles' [ajax](https://classics.domains.skidmore.edu/lit-campus-only/primary/translations/Sophocles%20Ajax.pdf), which tells the story of his death. immediately following the events of the iliad, ajax is upset because he thinks he should have been given achilles' armor after his death, but it was given to odysseus instead. \n\nhe flies into a murderous rage and plans to kill odysseus, agamemnon, and menelaus‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbut athena intervenes, and he ends up killing a bunch of their cattle instead, seeing them as humans instead of animals. when he realizes what he's done, he commits suicide out of shame. \n\nthen, we get to the real heart of the play (\u0026 my favorite part): teucer finds his body and wants to give him a proper burial, but menelaus tries to forbid him. an argument between the two ensues, and teucer just wrecks him‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâtalking about how ajax wasn't fighting in the war for him or his men, yet helped him anyway; how menelaus and the others hated ajax for no reason, when he never did anything wrong to them.\n\n\u003e**MENELAUS**: Is it just to defend a killer?\n\u003e\n\u003e**TEUCER**: How strange, to be killed and yet living!\n\u003e\n\u003e**MENELAUS**: A god saved me, but in his mind I was dead.\n\u003e\n\u003e**TEUCER**: So the gods saved you and now you dishonor the gods?\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e *(i really just think teucer's dialogue in this section goes so hard.)*\n\neventually, odysseus convinces agamemnon and menelaus that even their enemies deserve proper burials, that failure to do so would be to go against the will of the gods. i find it so interesting that the play opens with odysseus talking shit about ajax to athena, and ends with him defending ajax \u0026 offering to help teucer with the burial.\n\nthe final lines of the play, spoken by the chorus, are:\n\u003e Mortals know what their eyes can see,\n\u003e \n\u003e but of what will come out of time there is\n\u003e \n\u003e no seeing, no knowing what the end will be.\n\n### childe\n*childe* is a term for a \"young lord\" who has not yet achieved knighthood. if we just leave it there, it does make sense. he's the youngest of the harbingers, with the most to prove.\n\ni think there are a few other sources of inspiration for childe's title, though. one of them is [[notes/reference/childe harold|childe harold's pilgrimage]], a narrative poem by lord byron:\n\n\u003e it describes the travels and reflections of a world-weary¬†young man, who is disillusioned with a life of pleasure and revelry and looks for distraction in foreign lands\n\ni'm still making my way through this one, but i definitely see some of the inspiration for childe‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe way he's always traveling far away from home, never quite satisfied. the way he's lonely. \n\ni also came across a fairy tale called [[notes/reference/childe rowland|childe rowland]], which inspired robert browning's poem \"[childe rowland to the dark tower came](https://fivers.typepad.com/files/childe-roland-to-the-dark-tower-came.pdf).\" the story of childe rowland going to the dark tower reminds me somewhat of childe falling into the [[content/notes/places/abyss|abyss]] as a kid.\n\n### tartaglia\n[tartaglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartaglia_(commedia_dell%27arte)?useskin=vector) is one of the commedia dell'arte stock characters‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâi don't know a ton about commedia dell'arte, and it's weirdly difficult to dig into it online, so unfortunately i have nothing to offer here. for some of the other harbingers, it's not too hard to figure out why they've been given the role they have, but i'm not really sure where we're going with \"tartaglia\" yet.","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/characters/seelies":{"title":"seelies","content":"\n## fall of the seelies\n- a seelie ancestor fell in love with \"a traveler from afar\" (likely [[the second who came]]) \u0026 they pledged their union in [[the lunar palace]] 30 days before a \"disaster\"‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthey attempted to flee, but were punished by the heavens with eternal separation and a curse that took away their memories\n\t\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e i'm a little unclear on the order of operations here. my original notes say the \"disaster\" was presumably caused by a failed changing of the moons, but it seems more likely that the failed changing of the moons was caused *by* this \"disaster,\" which i'm assuming is the war btwn the primordial one + the second who came. did the second who came initiate a war against the primordial one‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâor did the primordial one seek to separate the couple first, leading to war?\n\n- the rest of the seelie civilization withered away due to grief\n- they have all been cursed to forget their past \u0026 are still pursuing their memories by guiding travelers to seelie courts\n- apparently a few seelie didn't wither away‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâa wolf-king (maybe [[andrius]]) met a still-humanoid seelie and befriended her;

Oldest to newest these are the¬†[Hadean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean \"Hadean\"),¬†[Archean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean \"Archean\"),¬†[Proterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic \"Proterozoic\"), and¬†[Phanerozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic \"Phanerozoic\").\n\nthose first two, \"hadean\" and \"archean,\" sound pretty interesting to me.\n\n### hadean\nhere's the etymology of the \"hadean\" eon / eonothem, via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean):\n\u003e \"Hadean\" (from¬†[Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades \"Hades\"), the Greek god of the underworld, and the underworld itself) describes the¬†[hellish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell \"Hell\")¬†conditions then prevailing on Earth: the planet had just formed and was still very hot owing to its recent¬†[accretion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(astrophysics) \"Accretion (astrophysics)\"), the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements, and frequent collisions with other Solar System bodies.\n\nthat reminds me a lot of [[content/notes/history/timeline|the old world]], before the era of archons in teyvat. the reference to the underworld is just a fun bonus.\n\n### archean\nthen we have the \"archean\" eon, which obviously brings to mind the archons of teyvat‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand i think it definitely makes sense to look at this period of time in teyvat as a second \"eon,\" following the period before the archon war. \n\nas for the etymology of \"archean,\" via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean):\n\u003e The word¬†_Archean_¬†comes from the Greek word¬†_arkhƒì_¬†([Œ±œÅœáŒÆ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%AE#Ancient_Greek \"wikt:Œ±œÅœáŒÆ\")), meaning 'beginning, origin'.\n\nanother thing i think is interesting:\n\u003e The¬†[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth \"Earth\")¬†during the Archean was mostly a water world: there was¬†[continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust \"Continental crust\"), but much of it was under an ocean deeper than today's ocean.\n\nwe're starting to get more and more hints about teyvat's ocean‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâi definitely believe that there's a lot underwater that we haven't even heard about yet. not to mention [[notes/places/enkanomiya|enkanomiya]].\n\n## ok so what does it mean?\ni don't know why they chose the goblet, specifically, as a symbol of eonothems. maybe it's linked to the [tarot suit of cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_of_goblets), which pertains to emotions, intuition, spirituality, and water. or maybe it's referencing the [holy grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail), symbolizing healing \u0026 infinite sustenance. idk! the descriptions of a lot of goblet pieces tend to be related to good, triumphant feelings, or happier times‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâor just times when someone was drinking.\n\nwhat i *do* know is the choice to call it the \"goblet of eonothem\" rather than the \"goblet of eon\" was deliberate‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand the same goes for the [[content/notes/items/artifacts/sands of eon]]. these pieces represent different, but related things; while the sands go hand-in-hand with the passage of time, the goblet represents something more physical. \n\nthe different eons of teyvat are important (especially the insinuation that there is another, perhaps post-archon eon coming later) but with the goblet, we're more focused on the layer of rock that buries teyvat's histories underground. we've seen \u0026 heard of plenty of ancient civilizations by now that used to live on the surface, but are now deep underground. and it will continue to happen, because that's the nature of the world.\n\ni'm still trying to figure out what *exactly* a goblet has to do with all that, but we'll get there.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/items/artifacts/plume-of-death":{"title":"plume of death","content":"\nsometimes the plume of death is a feather that has been plucked from or dropped by a bird, and sometimes it's taken from an arrow. sometimes the feather is being worn as an accessory of some kind, usually to signify strength.\n\nfeathers (and birds, for that matter) often symbolize freedom‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâso it's interesting to me that this piece is called the \"plume of death.\" ","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/items/artifacts/sands-of-eon":{"title":"sands of eon","content":"\na lot of my thoughts \u0026 explanations on eons are [[content/notes/items/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|over here]], where i wrote about the \"goblet of eonothem.\" tl;dr an *eonothem* refers to the huge layer of rock that covers the earth during a period of time, while an *eon* refers to the period of time itself. \n\n*eons* pretty clearly represent the passage of [[time]], so it makes sense that it would be used as the title for pieces like hourglasses, watches, and other timepieces. many of these pieces have stories about people running out of time, a theme we encounter a lot throughout the game.","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/items/artifacts/sets/adventurer":{"title":"adventurer","content":"\nthis set might be based on [herman](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Herman).\n\n## [[content/notes/items/artifacts/flower of life|adventurer's flower]]\n*\"A resilient flower that survived the harsh environment of [[an ancient city]].

it would take the boldest knight in Christendom to bring her back.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE] \n\u003e elfland is the home of the [light elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=D%C3%B6kk%C3%A1lfar_and_Lj%C3%B3s%C3%A1lfar\u0026useskin=vector) in norse mythology, in contrast to the dark elves that live within the earth. i have no idea if this is actually the elfland being referenced here, but wikipedia seems to think it is.\n\nafter his two older brothers leave to look for the dark tower \u0026 never return, childe harold decides to go himself. he begs his mother to let him go, and she gives him his father's sword for protection.\n\nbefore he leaves, merlin gives him some instructions for finding the dark tower: first, he has to use his sword to cut off the head of everyone he sees until he finds his sister; second, he can't eat or drink anything in elfland, or he'll be stuck there forever.\n\nhe eventually finds his sister in elfland, who tells him that their two other brothers had been enchanted by the king of elfland \u0026 gets him some food‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwhich he almost eats, before remembering he's not supposed to.\n\nat that moment, the elf king comes in with the classic *\"fee, fi, fo, fum\"* and childe rowland fights him for the lives of his siblings. he wins, and agrees to spare the king's life if he lets his brothers and sister leave unharmed‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand then all is well.\n\n## thoughts\nobviously, this story loosely makes me think of [[notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]] falling into the [[content/notes/places/abyss|abyss]] and barely making it out alive. the dark tower itself reminds me of [[content/notes/places/khaenriah|khaenri'ah]] and the [three realms gateway offering](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Three_Realms_Gateway_Offering) event in [[notes/places/enkanomiya|enkanomiya]]. \n\nthe idea of a \"dark tower\" being found in the [[notes/places/realms|light realm]] is so interesting to me‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâespecially if you *do* relate it to the abyss or khaenri'ah. definitely fits with the whole **light vs. dark =/= good vs. evil** theme throughout genshin.\n\nthe other thing this fairy tale reminds me of is the [gnostic chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0pkwZVL_GQ) story from the battle pass: the crowned heir being deceived while looking for the genesis pearl in the kingdom of darkness, and the second crowned heir following them to *\"take up the path where the first had stumbled.\"*\n\nthinking about this has given me a few questions about the gnostic chorus:\n- did the genesis pearl belong to the heavenly kingdom? was it lost, stolen? or was the crowned heir on a mission to take something that wasn't theirs?\n- was the second crowned heir going to look for the first? or were they simply going to attempt to find the genesis pearl on their own?\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/reference/motifs/memory":{"title":"memory","content":"\ni've been thinking a lot recently about [\"damnatio memoriae\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae?useskin=vector)‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâlatin for \"condemnation of memory.\" it feels very similar to irminsul erasure.","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/reference/motifs/moon":{"title":"moon","content":"\nthe moon represents **illusions and lies**.\n\n\u003e but if you trust your intuition and overcome your fears, the [[content/notes/reference/motifs/sun|sun]] will surely rise.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/reference/motifs/rose":{"title":"rose","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/reference/motifs/sun":{"title":"sun","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-09-04T15:22:30.800971306Z","tags":null},"/notes/reference/nero":{"title":"nero","content":"\ni've been learning a bit about [nero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero?useskin=vector) recently \u0026 there are just so many interesting things that remind me of both [[rex lapis]] and [[king deshret]]:\n- [the golden house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Aurea?useskin=vector) !!!\n- [[notes/reference/motifs/memory|damnatio memoriae]]\n- seeing himself as a [[notes/reference/motifs/sun|sun]] god‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâdeshret \u0026 rex lapis both lean quite heavily on the [[notes/reference/motifs/sun|sun]] imagery\n- the way he kinda went crazy \u0026 ended up with a horrible reputation, but was supposedly loved by his people \n- his love for architecture \u0026 the arts\n- the once-held [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Redivivus_legend?useskin=vector) that he would return (possibly as the antichrist?) after his death, or that he was actually still alive\n\n---\n\n\u003e ...See that?
