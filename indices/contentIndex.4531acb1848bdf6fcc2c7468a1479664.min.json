Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T16:34:59.448432157Z","tags":null},"/.trash/instructions/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub.

Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz?

You can leave the 'Parent Collection' field empty.\n5. Click into your newly made Collection.\n\t1. Press the 'share' button that looks like three dots connected by lines.\n\t2. Set the 'Interface Type' to `object-search` and click 'Create'.\n\t3. This will bring you to a new page with a search bar. Ignore this for now.\n6. Go back to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e API Keys and find your Quartz-specific Operand API key under 'Other keys'.\n\t1. Copy the key (which looks something like `0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910`).\n\t2. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[private/instructions/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T16:34:59.448432157Z","tags":null},"/.trash/instructions/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\nüìÅ [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](private/instructions/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](private/instructions/hosting.md) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](private/instructions/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](private/instructions/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](private/instructions/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](private/instructions/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](private/instructions/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](private/instructions/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](private/instructions/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T16:34:59.448432157Z","tags":null},"/.trash/instructions/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?

Oldest to newest these are the¬†[Hadean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean \"Hadean\"),¬†[Archean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean \"Archean\"),¬†[Proterozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proterozoic \"Proterozoic\"), and¬†[Phanerozoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanerozoic \"Phanerozoic\").\n\nthose first two, \"hadean\" and \"archean,\" sound pretty interesting to me.\n\n### hadean\nhere's the etymology of the \"hadean\" eon / eonothem, via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean):\n\u003e \"Hadean\" (from¬†[Hades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hades \"Hades\"), the Greek god of the underworld, and the underworld itself) describes the¬†[hellish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell \"Hell\")¬†conditions then prevailing on Earth: the planet had just formed and was still very hot owing to its recent¬†[accretion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(astrophysics) \"Accretion (astrophysics)\"), the abundance of short-lived radioactive elements, and frequent collisions with other Solar System bodies.\n\nthat reminds me a lot of [[notes/01 - timeline|the old world]], before the era of archons in teyvat. the reference to the underworld is just a fun bonus.\n\n### archean\nthen we have the \"archean\" eon, which obviously brings to mind the archons of teyvat‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand i think it definitely makes sense to look at this period of time in teyvat as a second \"eon,\" following the period before the archon war. \n\nas for the etymology of \"archean,\" via [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean):\n\u003e The word¬†_Archean_¬†comes from the Greek word¬†_arkhƒì_¬†([Œ±œÅœáŒÆ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%AE#Ancient_Greek \"wikt:Œ±œÅœáŒÆ\")), meaning 'beginning, origin'.\n\nanother thing i think is interesting:\n\u003e The¬†[Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth \"Earth\")¬†during the Archean was mostly a water world: there was¬†[continental crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust \"Continental crust\"), but much of it was under an ocean deeper than today's ocean.\n\nwe're starting to get more and more hints about teyvat's ocean‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâi definitely believe that there's a lot underwater that we haven't even heard about yet. not to mention [[enkanomiya]].\n\n## ok so what does it mean?\ni don't know why they chose the goblet, specifically, as a symbol of eonothems. maybe it's linked to the [tarot suit of cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_of_goblets), which pertains to emotions, intuition, spirituality, and water. or maybe it's referencing the [holy grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Grail), symbolizing healing \u0026 infinite sustenance. idk! the descriptions of a lot of goblet pieces tend to be related to good, triumphant feelings, or happier times‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâor just times when someone was drinking.\n\nwhat i *do* know is the choice to call it the \"goblet of eonothem\" rather than the \"goblet of eon\" was deliberate‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand the same goes for the [[notes/artifacts/sands of eon]]. these pieces represent different, but related things; while the sands go hand-in-hand with the passage of time, the goblet represents something more physical. \n\nthe different eons of teyvat are important (especially the insinuation that there is another, perhaps post-archon eon coming later) but with the goblet, we're more focused on the layer of rock that buries teyvat's histories underground. we've seen \u0026 heard of plenty of ancient civilizations by now that used to live on the surface, but are now deep underground. and it will continue to happen, because that's the nature of the world.\n\ni'm still trying to figure out what *exactly* a goblet has to do with all that, but we'll get there.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T16:34:59.448432157Z","tags":null},"/notes/artifacts/plume-of-death":{"title":"plume of death","content":"\nsometimes the plume of death is a feather that has been plucked from or dropped by a bird, and sometimes it's taken from an arrow. sometimes the feather is being worn as an accessory of some kind, usually to signify strength.\n\nfeathers (and birds, for that matter) often symbolize freedom‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâso it's interesting to me that this piece is called the \"plume of death.\" ","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T16:34:59.448432157Z","tags":null},"/notes/artifacts/sands-of-eon":{"title":"sands of eon","content":"\na lot of my thoughts \u0026 explanations on eons are [[notes/artifacts/goblet of eonothem|over here]], where i wrote about the \"goblet of eonothem.\" tl;dr an *eonothem* refers to the huge layer of rock that covers the earth during a period of time, while an *eon* refers to the period of time itself. \n\n*eons* pretty clearly represent the passage of [[time]], so it makes sense that it would be used as the title for pieces like hourglasses, watches, and other timepieces. many of these pieces have stories about people running out of time, a theme we encounter a lot throughout the game.","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T16:34:59.448432157Z","tags":null},"/notes/artifacts/sets/adventurer":{"title":"adventurer","content":"\nthis set might be based on [herman](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Herman).\n\n## [[notes/artifacts/flower of life|adventurer's flower]]\n*\"A resilient flower that survived the harsh environment of [[an ancient city]].

Eberhart would eventually turn on him, forcing him to flee to¬†Liyue¬†in disgrace. He joined the Skipper's crew and eventually met his end in battle against the sea monster that the Skipper sought to take revenge on. \n\nthe [[heart of depth]] artifact set tells the story of his travels with the skipper.\n\n[[the exile]] set might also be about parsifal but it gets a little muddy. first, it‚Äôs unclear if parsifal was exiled from mondstadt or if just chose to leave. second, the exile‚Äôs goblet was a family heirloom of the exile \u0026 it says he carved out the gem himself, whereas all the other parsifal lore says *he* carved out the sapphire of a goblet he stole from some noble house. who knows! could be another exiled aristocrat, but a lot of the details do seem to match up.\n\n## blue-eyed spear witch\nsometime while parsifal was in mondstadt, he met the **[[blue-eyed spear witch]]**‚Äîwho was a servant for an aristocratic family at the time.\n\n\u003e he was leaving a mansion with stolen goods and noticed a woman in a window whose eyes were as blue as the gem in the silver cup he had just stolen. Struck by her beauty, he climbed up to her, pried the blue gem out of the silver cup and gave it to her as a gift.\n\n\u003e Unfortunately, this blue gem had the crest of the ruling family on it, and when the woman's master found out she had it, she was punished, which caused her to become angry at Parsifal despite still being in love with him. The next time they met she warned that someday she would pay him back for the scars inflicted on her due to his actions, and they seemingly never met again.\n\nat some point before leaving mondstadt, parsifal stopped at the shop in [[heart‚Äôs desire (sapphire)]] to buy ‚Äúthe special [[wine]] that helps you forget about the one you long for‚Äù but it has already been purchased by the blue-eyed spear witch, who exchanged the sapphire he gave her for the wine.\n\nthe [[wine and song]] catalyst description tells the story of them meeting but gives them a happy ending where they went to explore the world together‚Äî‚ÄúFor no matter how the real story went, or how the two truly ended up, wine and songs brim with hope.‚Äù\n\nsupposedly, eberhart was trained by the blue-eyed spear witch after parsifal left mondstadt \u0026 later killed her‚Äîi don‚Äôt think it explicitly says anywhere that she died, but it‚Äôs heavily implied in the [[crescent pike]] weapon description\n\none other thing that i‚Äôm still not sure about that swirls around in my head a lot is the [[hex and hound]] book, which is about two shapeshifting sisters, one of which has blue eyes. i think it‚Äôs possible this is the blue-eyed spear witch, and if *that‚Äôs* true i think it‚Äôs possible she survived.\n\n## eberhart\neberhart was the half-brother of parsifal \u0026 ingbert‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhe resented his noble lineage \u0026 wanted to ‚Äúrecapture the glory and pride of ancient nobility‚Äù and ‚Äúdestroy these rotten foundations.‚Äù[^1]\n\nhe was the owner of the unnamed gladiator that was killed by [[vennessa]] from the [[gladiator]] artifact set (to give you a sense of the timeline).\n\nhe went on an expedition to [[dragonspine]] with ingbert \u0026 and a few other aristocrats‚Äîon this expedition, he laid traps \u0026 killed the others. he was supposedly gravely wounded, and we‚Äôre not sure if he lived / made it back to mondstadt.\n\nlater, he became the [[blue-eyed spear witch]]‚Äôs disciple (knowing she was in love with parsifal) ‚Äúto learn the fatal loophole in her art, all the better to slay her with‚Ä¶‚Äù \u0026 killed her[^1]\n\n\u003e So what if those who came after should despise me? I will do anything to achieve my goals.\n\n\n## the many versions of parsifal\nparsifal is an [[opera]] written by richard wagner, based on the arthurian story parzival that was written about a character named percival. are we taking notes.\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e **important to note:** genshin *loves* wagner. they are obsessed with this guy. \n\n\n### percival\nthe original percival was one of the knights of the round table in arthurian legend, and was the hero in the quest for the holy grail (before later being replaced by galahad).\n\nto be honest, the story of percival doesn‚Äôt seem to have a ton in common with genshin‚Äôs parsifal: percival comes across the fisher king, who is wounded; if he asks the king a particular ‚Äúhealing question,‚Äù he can heal the king \u0026 save his kingdom \u0026 get the holy grail etc; he doesn‚Äôt know this, so he doesn‚Äôt ask the question.\n\nin most versions, percival‚Äôs mother hides him in the woods when he‚Äôs born because she doesn‚Äôt want him to become a knight like his father or something, but then 3 knights come across them and i guess he thinks they‚Äôre so cool he wants to be a knight too. he leaves, \u0026 his mother usually dies of grief. fun stuff!\n\n### parzival\nin **parzival**, the story continues past his initial failure to ask the healing question \u0026 leads to him becoming the grail king. one interesting thing in this version is that the fisher king gets a name, anfortas, which is also the name of the leader of the [[schwanenritter]] (swan knights) in [[khaenri‚Äôah]]. \n\n### parsifal\nthe opera version is called **parsifal**, ‚Äúinformed by one of the theories about the name percival, according to which it is of persian origin, meaning ‚Äòpure (or poor) fool‚Äô‚Äù‚Äîwhenever the word fool comes up i obviously think of the [[fatui]].\n\nanyway! in this version, the fisher king (now named amfortas) was stabbed with the holy spear, and it basically turns out that parsifal is fated to find the spear \u0026 heal his wound. this version also gives more of a backstory to his injury‚Äîamfortas had the holy spear, but lost it \u0026 was stabbed with it in battle because he got distracted by a pretty lady.\n\nthere is a LOT going on in this opera \u0026 it‚Äôs all really cool and definitely shares themes with genshin but it‚Äôs too much to get into right now‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhopefully i'll get a chance to revisit this later.\n\n## lohengrin\ngood news, the parzival character also shows up in ANOTHER wagner [[opera]] called lohengrin, which is based on the story lohengrin, which is a sequel to parzival. isn‚Äôt this fun.\n\nlohengrin is the son of parzival, and he is ‚Äúa grail knight sent in a boat pulled by swans to rescue a maiden who can never ask his identity‚Äù‚Äîthis is basically just a variation of the classic knight of the swan story. in one of the original swan knight stories, the name of the swan knight is helias. ([[notes/sun|sun]] god!)\n\n\n\u003e [!NOTE]\n\u003e the knight of the swan story also ties into melusines, which we'll apparently be seeing in fontaine. the whole never-ask-my-name thing \u0026 related variations has come up a lot in genshin‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâhopefully i will remember to compile some notes on it at some point.\n\n\nlohengrin‚Äôs twin brother inherits their father parzival‚Äôs land while lohengrin is sent out as a grail knight ‚Äúin secret‚Äù to help kingdoms that have lost their protectors. he shows up in a kingdom without a male heir \u0026 offers marry the duchess there \u0026 defend the kingdom, on the condition that she must never ask his name. all is good for a few years, but then she asks the question \u0026 he gets right back on his swan boat and never returns.\n\nin the opera, the reason lohengrin shows up \u0026 has to defend the duchess is because she‚Äôs being wrongfully accused of murdering her brother‚Äîin the end, it turns out the swan from the swan boat is her brother, who was cursed by a witch lol.\n\n## irish myth stuff\nvia wikipedia:\n\u003e There are possible parallels in¬†*Perceval*¬†with the Irish mythological race of the¬†[Tuatha D√© Danann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann). The race has three central talismans, a spear, a cauldron, and a sword, that correlate with the spear, grail, and sword present in¬†*Perceval*.[^ ]Chr√©tien's¬†*Perceval*¬†also includes many similarities to the Irish saga¬†*[The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boyhood_Deeds_of_Fionn)*. The main character,¬†[Fionn mac Cumhaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill), is raised in isolation and undergoes many adventures akin to those of Perceval, suggesting that the narrative may have been a source of inspiration for Chr√©tien.\n\n\nwithout getting too in the weeds here because this is all a story for another day, i have a suspicion that [[fontaine]] is going to incorporate a lot of stuff from irish mythology. especially that last character, fionn.\n\nfor now, just know that irish mythology is divided into four cycles: the mythological cycle, the ulster cycle, the fianna cycle, and the kings‚Äô cycle. the ulster cycle in particular is mostly about a hero named cu chulainn, who manymanymany people have speculated was a source of inspiration for [[notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]].\n\ncu chulainn was trained by a warrior woman named scathach (possibly [[skirk]]!) who gave him his spear, gae bulg‚Äîthe description of the spear is honestly not too far off from childe's hydro weapons‚Äîand he basically becomes this insane hero at a young age who turns into ‚Äúan unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe‚Äù when fights. (like literally, that is not a metaphor, he becomes a monster. very foul legacy of him.)\n\n## childe\nthis is farfetched, but i basically have a theory that [[notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]] is somehow a distant descendant of parsifal and the blue-eyed spear witch‚Äîthe resemblance of the heart of depth guy, the fact that he uses the [[freedom talent books]] from mondstadt, the dead blue eyes.\n\nlet it be known that i had this theory first but ashikai has [a good video]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPUcllAoxFo\u0026pp=ygUOYXNoaWthaSBjaGlsZGU%3D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPUcllAoxFo\u0026pp=ygUOYXNoaWthaSBjaGlsZGU%3D)) about it that i think will cover everything quicker \u0026 more efficiently than i can.\n\n## dragonspine\ni find it really interesting that [[notes/characters/playable/childe|childe]], parsifal, and eberhart all have ties to [[dragonspine]]:\n- the [[heart of depth]] artifact set, which tells parsifal's story, is in a dragonspine domain\n- eberhart led that fateful expedition to dragonspine\n- childe is shown in dragonspine in one of his character videos\n- [[durin]]'s corrupted heart being in dragonspine reminds me a lot of whatever is going on with childe re: foul legacy \u0026 the [[abyss]]\n- for some reason, the battle music in dragonspine is [all-conquering tide](https://open.spotify.com/track/5BVQORtwCg5PtOUG5GR9B5?si=be8e6c36e63145c2)‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâa song that‚Äôs pretty clearly associated with childe, was in the domain in his story quest, and is not even on the dragonspine album\n\n[^1]: via favonius lance description","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T16:34:59.448432157Z","tags":null},"/notes/characters/playable/childe":{"title":"childe","content":"\n## names\n### ajax\nthe name \"ajax\" comes from [the greek hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_the_Great?useskin=vector) who fought with the achaeans in the trojan war. he's portrayed as being a very strong, skilled fighter but also kind of an arrogant, silly little jock boy. he also has a brother named teucer!\n\nobviously, he's mentioned in the iliad. he's also a prominent character in [troilus and cressida](https://shakespeare.mit.edu/troilus_cressida/full.html), where he is chosen to fight hector in one-on-one combat in place of achilles, who is busy wallowing and being depressed. (achilles does end up killing hector to avenge patroclus, before being killed himself.) the other greeks spend a lot of time making fun of him in this play‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâit's honestly very funny, and i recommend reading it.\n\nas with all other names pulled from greek mythology in genshin, we can assume the name ajax comes from [[enkanomiya]] (or the ancient [[unified civilization]], of which enkanomiya was just a part). this + his weapon looking suspiciously like the ones all over enkanomiya is pretty interesting. \n\n#### sophocles\ni also recommend reading sophocles' [ajax](https://classics.domains.skidmore.edu/lit-campus-only/primary/translations/Sophocles%20Ajax.pdf), which tells the story of his death. immediately following the events of the iliad, ajax is upset because he thinks he should have been given achilles' armor after his death, but it was given to odysseus instead. \n\nhe flies into a murderous rage and plans to kill odysseus, agamemnon, and menelaus‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbut athena intervenes, and he ends up killing a bunch of their cattle instead, seeing them as humans instead of animals. when he realizes what he's done, he commits suicide out of shame. \n\nthen, we get to the real heart of the play (\u0026 my favorite part): teucer finds his body and wants to give him a proper burial, but menelaus tries to forbid him. an argument between the two ensues, and teucer just wrecks him‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâtalking about how ajax wasn't fighting in the war for him or his men, yet helped him anyway;
